## Understanding How the Internet Addressing System Functions

When using the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address, such as ```60.220.117.116```, or an IPv6 address, like ```2000:e869:5461:f770:f67f:ac7f:9b14:9594```. Verification of this information can be done at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying these addresses to individuals who are not technologically inclined can be error-prone and complicated, especially when dealing with MAC addresses like ```32:b0:11:1f:08:30```. Additionally, this method does not provide historical data from previous occurrences.
## Navigating the World Wide Web
In order to access a webpage, such as https://thompson.io, you first connect to a DNS server to translate the host portion (thompson) in combination with the Top Level Domain (io) of the URL to an IP address, such as ```119.225.184.0```. Your computer and browser include its type in all web requests, for example:
```html
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win 9x 4.90; SG; rv:1.9.2.4) Gecko/20101104 Netscape/9.1.0285
```
## Understanding the Significance of Default Gateways
Typically, your default gateway is automatically configured through DHCP and you are assigned an address such as ```10.139.43.252``` (although they typically end in .1 or .254 based on the scope size), which serves as the destination for all your computer's outgoing traffic. For a detailed analysis on ```IPv6```, refer to [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). On Mac or Linux, you can verify this using the following command:
```html
ifconfig | grep inet6
```
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  10.139.43.252    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:4d0:46fc:10b3:e51c%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {57.151.106.47, 255.27.113.247}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 32:b0:11:1f:08:30
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 8c:b6:63:64:b5:23
}</pre>




## Addressing Connectivity Issues for Wired and Wireless Networks
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you might be utilizing either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple's macOS
Regardless of whether you are running OSX/macOS version ```10.15.4```, ```11.6.4```, or ```12.2.2```, there are several tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a set of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, especially for teams adopting remote work and the Work From Anywhere (WFA) approach.
#### Useful Built-in Utilities
One valuable tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of the current wireless settings to the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to create a wide range of logs, although many are only relevant to a specific point in time, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz``` for you. Alternatively, you can run ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` interactively (although there is minimal interaction) and it will give a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` or use Finder with Cmd+Shift+G to locate the path. However, be mindful of the file sizes, which are approximately 300MB.
