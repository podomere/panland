## Understanding Internet Protocol Addresses

When using the Internet, you are assigned an identifying number known as an IP address. This number may appear in the form of a Public IPv4 address, such as ```171.74.146.70```, or an IPv6 address, such as ```2000:e412:e46a:7d46:45a7:e7f9:9c9:4885```. To check your IP address, you can visit [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). Communicating these addresses, or even mentioning MAC addresses like ```4b:f2:1e:7f:27:4f```, can be error-prone and confusing, especially for individuals with limited technical knowledge. Furthermore, without historical data, it becomes challenging to address previous issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web
Accessing a webpage, such as https://morar.info, involves initially reaching out to a DNS server to translate the URL's host portion (morar) and Top Level Domain (info) into an IP address, such as ```250.222.107.27```. Interestingly, your computer and browser divulge their type with all web requests using a format like: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2228.0 Safari/537.36```
## Understanding the Significance of Default Gateways
Your default gateway is typically an automatically assigned address through DHCP and usually ends in .1 or .254, depending on the scope size. This is the point where your computer sends all its traffic to be routed onward. For a more in-depth look at IPv6, you can visit [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/) or check on Mac or Linux using the following command: <br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.222    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:664c:7bd1:2770:2a5d%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {58.142.32.54, 172.130.153.28}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 4b:f2:1e:7f:27:4f
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 69:b2:f0:29:6c:ee
}</pre>




## Resolve Connectivity Issues with Wired and Wireless Networks

When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be utilizing either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX Users

Regardless of which version of OSX/macOS you are using, be it 10.11.4, 11.4.8, or 12.3.3, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, the manual actions and scripts provided do not offer a set of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes particularly beneficial, especially for teams that are advocates of remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Helpful Built-in Scripts for Troubleshooting

On OSX/macOS, the ```sudo wdutil info``` tool can provide a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI, and it can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Furthermore, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool offers a more comprehensive option for generating a wide array of logs (although much of it is only relevant to wireless settings, similar to wdutil).

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz``` for you. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can execute<br>```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` and it will display a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
