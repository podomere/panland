## The Mechanism of Internet Addressing

When connecting to the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address, such as ```246.73.129.31```, or an IPv6 address like ```2000:ee9a:a6f9:34e1:1994:857b:2147:e570```. You can verify this information using [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, for individuals who are not technologically inclined, conveying these addresses, or even reading out MAC addresses like ```7d:b6:7f:cb:12:4e```, can be prone to mistakes and can become cumbersome. Moreover, this method does not provide any historical data (especially relating to past issues).
## Navigating the Internet

In order to access a website like https://yundt-feeney.info, you first connect to a DNS server to convert the host portion (yundt-feeney) in combination with the Top Level Domain (info) of the URL into an IP address, such as ```75.17.118.43```. Your computer and browser transmit their specifications with all web requests, for example: <br>```Opera/9.80 (X11; Linux i686; Ubuntu/14.10) Presto/2.12.388 Version/12.16```
## Understanding the Significance of Default Gateways

Your default gateway is typically an address that is automatically configured via DHCP. You receive a default gateway like ```192.0.0.123``` (although they generally end in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size), and this is where your computer sends all of its traffic to be routed onwards. For ```IPv6```, we provide an in-depth discussion on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), but you can verify this on Mac or Linux using:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.123    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:ee01:ec17:cfd7:2ceb%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {103.7.90.85, 12.117.169.148}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 7d:b6:7f:cb:12:4e
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr e1:4e:e6:88:90:75
}</pre>




## Fixing Connectivity Issues in Wired or Wireless Networks
When it comes to sending data to your router, you may be utilizing either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Resolving macOS / OSX Network Problems
Regardless of whether you are running OSX/macOS ```10.11.1```, ```11.5.8```, or ```12.1.7```, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a set of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, especially for teams that are adopting remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA) practices.
#### Useful Built-in Utilities
A very useful tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of the current wireless settings to the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is related to wireless and is point-in-time only, similar to wdutil.

To run ```sysdiagnose``` in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` and be aware of the large file sizes, around 300MB.
