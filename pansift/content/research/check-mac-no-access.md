## The Fundamentals of Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you will be assigned either a Public IPv4 address, such as `49.149.58.162`, or an IPv6 address, such as `2000:a3ee:42df:b498:58b1:2dad:950b:c284`. You can verify this at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, for those who are not well-versed in technology, conveying and working with these addresses, or even referencing MAC addresses like `fc:3c:d8:e2:c7:28`, can be prone to errors and become complex very quickly. Furthermore, this method does not provide any historical data, especially when addressing past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web
When attempting to access a webpage, such as https://torp.name, the first step is connecting to a DNS server to translate the host portion (torp) in conjunction with the Top Level Domain (name) of the URL into an IP address like `139.48.249.218`. Each web request from your computer and browser includes details about its type, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; AS; rv:11.0) like Gecko```
## Understanding the Significance of Default Gateways
Your default gateway is typically an address that is configured automatically through DHCP. This gateway address, such as `10.60.229.70` (although it usually ends in .1 or .254, depending on the scope size), is where your computer routes all its traffic. For a comprehensive insight into IPv6, refer to [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). You can also verify this on Mac or Linux by using:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  10.60.229.70    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:4c83:b1a0:246e:e080%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {79.221.161.112, 163.176.229.167}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr fc:3c:d8:e2:c7:28
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr be:81:e5:02:c4:05
}</pre>




## Resolving Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections
When it comes to transferring data to your router, you may be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of the version of OSX/macOS you are using, whether it's ```10.11.8```, ```11.0.5```, or ```12.0.3```, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes essential, particularly for teams that are focused on remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Effective Built-in Scripts
One useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific troubleshooting logs. Furthermore, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although many of them are only relevant to a specific point in time related to wireless, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```. If you prefer to run it *interactively*, you can use ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` and it will prompt a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. However, be cautious of the file sizes, which are around 300MB more or less.
