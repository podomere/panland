## Understanding the Function of IP Addresses

When accessing the Internet, you are assigned a unique IP address, such as ```79.50.91.222``` for IPv4 or ```2000:cdf0:eff1:8190:9f0f:7abc:987e:be``` for IPv6. Verifying these addresses is possible by visiting [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, communicating these addresses to those who are not well-versed in technology, or referencing MAC addresses like ```1d:4b:bc:78:fb:cb```, can be prone to errors and become convoluted. Furthermore, this method does not provide historical data, especially when addressing previous problems.
## Navigating to Websites

To reach a website like https://hahn.com, the first step involves accessing a DNS server to translate the host portion (hahn) combined with the Top Level Domain (com) of the URL into an IP address, such as ```160.243.198.113```. Every web request from your computer and browser includes its type, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; AS; rv:11.0) like Gecko```
## Significance of Automatic Gateways

Your default gateway is typically an address that is automatically configured through DHCP. It is likely that you receive a default gateway like ```172.16.93.10``` (commonly ending in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size), which is where your computer directs all of its traffic to be routed onwards. For ```IPv6```, detailed instructions for Mac or Linux can be found in the article [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/).
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  172.16.93.10    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:b8af:4f59:18b3:4157%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {73.16.153.34, 10.73.234.114}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 1d:4b:bc:78:fb:cb
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 1c:4f:13:ac:4f:d5
}</pre>




## Resolving Connectivity Issues: Wired vs. Wireless

When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be using a medium that is either wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of which version of OSX/macOS you are using, whether it's ```10.12.5```, ```11.6.1```, or ```12.2.4```, there are various tools available for solving connectivity issues. However, these tools do not provide a series of correlated values over time, which is essential for remote troubleshooting, especially for teams involved in remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
A very useful tool for OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only point-in-time related to wireless, similar to wdutil.

To run it in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. For an interactive (but minimal interaction) experience, run the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will give a privacy warning. If not run in the background, it will open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Keep in mind that the file sizes are around 300MB.
