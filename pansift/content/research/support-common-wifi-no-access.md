## Understanding How IP Addressing Functions

When using the Internet, you may be assigned a Public IPv4 address such as ```23.223.96.127``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:6d24:ebaf:5281:5dc0:f6df:e110:8cd6```. Verifying this is possible at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying these addresses, or even referencing MAC addresses like ```79:ef:68:64:90:03```, can be error-prone and quickly become complexâ€”particularly for individuals who are not well-versed in technology. Furthermore, this information does not provide any historical context, particularly when attempting to address past issues.
## Navigating the Internet

To access a webpage like https://rodriguez.co, the first step is to connect to a DNS server, which then translates the host portion (rodriguez) combined with the Top Level Domain (co) of the URL into an IP address, such as ```52.158.7.23```. Notably, all web requests from your computer and browser include information about its type, for instance: <br>```Opera/9.80 (X11; Linux i686; Ubuntu/14.10) Presto/2.12.388 Version/12.16```
## Understanding the Significance of Default Gateways

Typically, your default gateway is an address that is automatically configured through DHCP. This default gateway could be in the form of ```172.24.71.49``` (although these addresses typically end in .1 or .254, depending on the scope size). This is the point to which your computer directs all of its traffic for further routing. For ```IPv6```, an in-depth explanation is available on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), but this information can also be verified on Mac or Linux machines with: <br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  172.24.71.49    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:cbab:f285:41be:b698%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {97.119.90.188, 220.106.32.169}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 79:ef:68:64:90:03
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr b6:df:de:5c:60:41
}</pre>




## Resolving Connectivity Issues for Wired and Wireless Networks
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Tips for Troubleshooting on Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of whether you are using OSX/macOS versions such as 10.11.9, 11.6.2, or 12.2.7, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these tools and manual actions do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, particularly for teams engaged in remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA) setups.
#### Harnessing the Power of Built-in Scripts
One useful tool on OSX/macOs is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool offers a more comprehensive approach, generating a wide range of logs (although many of them are point-in-time in relation to wireless, similar to wdutil).

To run the sysdiagnose tool in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, you can use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will provide a privacy warning. When running it interactively, the Finder should open in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` manually or by using the Finder shortcut Cmd+Shift+G. Keep in mind that the file sizes will be approximately 300MB.
