## The Functioning of Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, individuals may have a Public IPv4 address, such as ```236.8.56.70```, or an IPv6 address, such as ```2000:3cd1:a60f:c7b:8044:acbe:1f08:a422```. This information can be verified at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). Despite this, translating and referencing these addresses, as well as MAC addresses like ```c0:39:c9:83:d5:77```, can be prone to errors and become complex, especially for those not well-versed in technology. Furthermore, it does not provide any historical data, particularly for previous issues.
## Navigating through the Internet

When attempting to access a webpage such as https://hilpert-oreilly.co, the initial step involves contacting a DNS server to convert the host part (hilpert-oreilly) in combination with the Top Level Domain (co) of the URL to an IP address like ```171.144.12.41```. Every web request made by your computer and browser contains its version information. For example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT x.y; Win64; x64; rv:10.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0```
## Understanding the Significance of Default Gateways

Usually, the default gateway is an automatically configured address obtained via DHCP. A typical default gateway address might be ```10.18.254.224``` (although they usually end in .1 or .254 based on the scope size), and this is where your computer sends all its traffic to be directed further. For ```IPv6```, more detailed information can be found in our article on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), or it can be verified on Mac or Linux using the following method:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  10.18.254.224    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:75bb:76f7:a146:3f46%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {154.34.223.248, 90.239.247.192}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr c0:39:c9:83:d5:77
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 26:d2:8c:b3:4b:cc
}</pre>




## Troubleshooting Connectivity on Apple Devices

When it comes to sending data to your router, you may be using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Effective Solutions for Apple macOS / OSX Users

Regardless of the version of OSX/macOS you are using, whether it's ```10.14.2```, ```11.0.8```, or ```12.2.1```, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes essential, especially for teams that practice remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts for Troubleshooting

One incredibly useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which offers a dump of current wireless-related settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a comprehensive set of logs, although much of it is only related to wireless on a point-in-time basis, similar to wdutil.

To run ```sysdiagnose``` in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, you can use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will trigger a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
