## Understanding the Functionality of Internet Addressing

When navigating the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address, such as ```88.24.239.206```, or an IPv6 address like ```2000:da51:3fad:1ae2:4622:cb57:2cf9:1c97```. These addresses can be verified by visiting [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying these addresses to individuals who lack technical expertise, or even referencing MAC addresses like ```a3:87:c9:e5:f9:35```, proves to be error-prone and becomes complex in a short amount of time. In addition, this method fails to provide any historical data, especially regarding past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

To access a web page, such as https://koss.net, your computer initially connects to a DNS server to translate the host portion (koss) combined with the Top Level Domain (net) of the URL into an IP address, such as ```51.162.72.13```. Every web request sent by your computer and browser includes the type, for example: ```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT x.y; Win64; x64; rv:10.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0```
## The Significance of Default Gateways

Your default gateway is typically an automatically configured address via DHCP. A default gateway, such as ```10.7.164.164``` (although they usually end in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size), is where your computer forwards all of its traffic to be routed further. For ```IPv6```, in-depth information is available at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), but you can also check on Mac or Linux with this command:
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  10.7.164.164    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:a877:86b6:8cc6:8f6d%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {143.157.2.63, 237.126.26.123}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr a3:87:c9:e5:f9:35
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 5a:97:ab:de:6e:38
}</pre>




## Resolve Issues with Wired and Wireless Network Connection
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you might be using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Steps to Take for Apple macOS / OSX Troubleshooting
No matter which version of OSX/macOS you are currently using, whether it's 10.11.5, 11.6.5, or 12.1.7, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, especially for teams that embrace remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Utilizing Built-in Scripts for Assistance
One valuable tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless related settings to the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is point-in-time only in relation to wireless, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will generate logs in ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz``` for you. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will give a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` or use Finder with Cmd+Shift+G to point Finder to the path. Keep in mind the file sizes, which are approximately 300MB.
