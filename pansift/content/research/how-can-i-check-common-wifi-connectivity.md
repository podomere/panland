## Understanding Internet Addressing

When you connect to the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address or an IPv6 address. You can verify your address at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying these addresses to non-technical individuals or discussing MAC addresses can be prone to errors and become complex. Moreover, these addresses do not provide historical data, particularly for past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

To access a website such as https://schaden.co, your computer first reaches out to a DNS server to translate the host and Top Level Domain of the URL into an IP address. Additionally, your computer and browser include information about their type in all web requests, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT x.y; Win64; x64; rv:10.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0```
## Understanding the Significance of Default Gateways

The default gateway is usually automatically configured through DHCP and is the point where your computer sends all its outgoing traffic. In the case of IPv6, you can refer to a detailed post on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/) or check on Mac or Linux with:<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  10.141.94.77    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:ff2d:945f:256d:6bbc%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {67.168.114.144, 153.110.22.91}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr f0:d9:b4:d5:08:e5
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr c0:ae:88:39:79:04
}</pre>




## Fixing Connectivity Issues for Wired and Wireless Networks

When it comes to sending data to your router, you may be utilizing either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of whether you are using OSX/macOS versions such as 10.11.2, 11.3.6, or 12.0.3, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these tools do not provide a series of correlated values over time, which is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes beneficial, especially for teams that are transitioning to remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Utilizing In-Built Scripts to Aid Troubleshooting
A useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting purposes. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only relevant to wireless at a specific point in time, similar to wdutil.

To run ```sysdiagnose``` in the background and generate logs at ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, you can use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will provide a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, and you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Cmd+Shift+G or use Finder to locate the path. It's important to note that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
