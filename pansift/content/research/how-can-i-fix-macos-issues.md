## Understanding Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 or IPv6 address, such as ```1.74.186.96``` or ```2000:f2a5:c57e:c0d9:10b0:14fc:49fb:b621```. Verification can be done on [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). Communicating, or even referencing MAC addresses like ```dd:d7:cf:32:64:ff```, can be challenging for non-technical individuals and can quickly become complex. Moreover, this method lacks historical data, particularly during previous issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

In order to access a website like https://ward.com, you initially send a request to a DNS server to translate the host (ward) and the Top Level Domain (com) of the URL into its corresponding IP address, such as ```226.185.130.85```. Your computer and browser include their specifications in all web requests, such as <br>```Opera/9.80 (X11; Linux i686; Ubuntu/14.10) Presto/2.12.388 Version/12.16```.
## Significance of Default Gateways

The default gateway is typically an address automatically configured via DHCP, such as ```10.170.34.221``` (commonly ending in .1 or .254, depending on the scope size). This is the point where your computer directs all its outgoing traffic for further routing. For ```IPv6```, a detailed explanation can be found at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), and for Mac or Linux systems, you can verify this using:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  10.170.34.221    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:ebc8:c22e:6995:a492%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {127.142.52.132, 140.36.99.201}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr dd:d7:cf:32:64:ff
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 1b:a4:c4:21:ff:f5
}</pre>




## Resolving Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of whether you are running OSX/macOS version ```10.13.2```, ```11.5.2```, or ```12.1.3```, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual methods and scripts do not provide a consistent set of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes invaluable, particularly for teams that adopt remote work and the Work From Anywhere (WFA) approach.
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
A highly useful tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific troubleshooting logs. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool offers a more comprehensive option for generating a wide range of logs, although much of it is related to wireless settings and is only point-in-time data, similar to wdutil.

To run it in the background and generate logs in ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, use ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will prompt a privacy warning. If not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` or use Finder with Cmd+Shift+G to locate the files. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
