## Understanding Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned a unique Public IPv4 address, such as ```132.53.38.190```, or an IPv6 address, such as ```2000:5b7b:3b13:f7d4:24b:a76e:3db6:1413```. You can verify this information by visiting [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, explaining and communicating these addresses, and even MAC addresses like ```1a:ec:6a:8c:51:53```, to individuals who are not technologically savvy can be complex and error-prone. Moreover, this method does not provide any historical data, particularly relating to past issues.
## Navigating the Web

To access a website, such as https://kris.info, you first connect to a DNS server to convert the host segment (kris) combined with the Top Level Domain (info) of the URL into an IP address, like ```226.195.56.80```. Whenever your computer and browser makes web requests, it includes its type, for example: 
```Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; AOL 9.7; AOLBuild 4343.19; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; FunWebProducts)```
## Significance of Default Gateways

Typically, your default gateway is an automatically assigned address through DHCP. You are given a default gateway, such as ```192.0.0.60```, (although they typically end in .1 or .254, depending on the scope size), and this is the point where your computer sends all of its traffic to be routed further. For ```IPv6```, detailed instructions can be found at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), but you can verify it on a Mac or Linux system using:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.60    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:b3b:e96a:297c:37fa%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {189.253.60.61, 133.33.165.244}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 1a:ec:6a:8c:51:53
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 0d:a3:74:d1:a9:c8
}</pre>




## Fixing Issues with Wired or Wireless Connections
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you might be using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Resolving Problems on Apple macOS / OSX
Irrespective of whether you are using OSX/macOS versions like ```10.13.7```, ```11.3.8```, or ```12.3.4```, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a set of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes essential, particularly for teams that support remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Utilizing Built-in Scripts
One useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific troubleshooting logs. Furthermore, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be employed to generate a wide range of logs, although most are only point-in-time related to wireless, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` will execute the tool in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```. If you want to run it *interactively* (though there is minimal interaction), you can use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` and it will display a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` or use Finder with Cmd+Shift+G to access the path. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
