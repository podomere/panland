## Functioning of Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, a Public IPv4 address such as ```71.153.160.169``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:ae57:6b1:2139:9154:30d5:1a39:c914``` may be assigned. Verification can be performed at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying these addresses, or referring to MAC addresses like ```15:52:4d:dd:50:c0```, can be prone to errors and becomes complex, particularly for non-technical users. Additionally, this method does not provide historical data, especially for past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web
In order to access a web page such as https://rath-runolfsdottir.io, the initial step involves contacting a DNS server to convert the host portion (rath-runolfsdottir) combined with the Top Level Domain (io) of the URL into an IP address, for example: ```0.67.0.67```. Interestingly, with every web requests, your computer and browser convey the type, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_3) AppleWebKit/537.75.14 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/7.0.3 Safari/7046A194A```
## Significance of Default Gateways
The default gateway is typically an address automatically configured via DHCP. For instance, a default gateway like ```10.182.216.246``` (usually ending in .1 or .254 based on the scope size) is where your computer directs all its traffic for routing. For ```IPv6```, detailed guidance is available at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), while verification on Mac or Linux can be done using: <br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  10.182.216.246    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:2ed8:52ad:a94c:e12a%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {133.150.53.245, 23.89.1.215}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 15:52:4d:dd:50:c0
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 7b:67:ab:68:05:1c
}</pre>




## Troubleshooting and resolving connectivity issues

When it comes to sending data to your router, you may be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Resolving issues on Apple macOS / OSX

No matter which version of OSX/macOS you are using, whether it's 10.11.7, 11.4.6, or 12.0.5, there are various tools available for resolving connectivity problems. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, especially for teams that embrace remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Utilizing built-in scripts

One particularly useful tool on OSX/macOS is `sudo wdutil info`, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Moreover, the `sysdiagnose` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only relevant to wireless settings at a specific point in time, similar to wdutil.

Running `sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &` in the background will write logs to `/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz` for you. If you prefer an *interactive* approach (although there isn't much interaction), you can run `sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose`, which will display a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, allowing you to navigate to `/var/tmp` or use Finder with Cmd+Shift+G to point Finder to the path. Just be aware that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
