## Understanding the Function of Internet Addressing

When connecting to the internet, users are assigned a Public IPv4 address or an IPv6 address, which can be confirmed using [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). Communicating these addresses or MAC addresses can be complex, especially for those unfamiliar with technology, and does not provide historical data.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

Accessing a website such as https://hoppe-herzog.info involves accessing a DNS server to translate the URL's host portion and Top Level Domain to an IP address. The web browser also sends its type with all requests, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2228.0 Safari/537.36```
## Understanding the Significance of Default Gateways

By default, the gateway is assigned automatically via DHCP and is the address where a computer sends all of its traffic to be routed onwards. The default gateway typically ends in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size for an IPv4 address. You can check the default gateway on Mac or Linux by referring to [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/) for IPv6 issues.
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.91    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:1bae:2151:6fc0:a7f3%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {65.57.232.78, 128.238.67.89}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 12:77:69:40:9a:bb
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 23:15:d5:69:90:0f
}</pre>




## Resolve Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections
When it comes to sending data to your router, you might be utilizing a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
No matter which version of OSX/macOS you are currently using, whether it's ```10.15.9```, ```11.3.6```, or ```12.0.1```, there are various tools available for resolving issues. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes essential, particularly for teams that are embracing remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
A helpful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of the current wireless settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific troubleshooting logs. In addition, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although most of it is only relevant to wireless settings, similar to wdutil.

To run it in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, use ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, but keep in mind that it will give a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Cmd+Shift+G in Finder. However, be aware that file sizes are around 300MB.
