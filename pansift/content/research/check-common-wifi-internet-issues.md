## Understanding the Functionality of Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, it is common to have a Public IPv4 address, such as ```5.181.6.26```, or an IPv6 address, like ```2000:ce70:7959:5705:92a0:2900:42ae:4270```. These can be verified by visiting [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, relaying these addresses to individuals who are not technologically inclined or even mentioning MAC addresses, like ```c1:d6:35:0d:0f:79```, can become complicated and prone to errors. Furthermore, historical data is not accessible, especially concerning past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

Accessing a web page, such as https://lebsack.name, initially requires querying a DNS server to convert the host portion (lebsack) combined with the Top Level Domain (name) of the URL into an IP address, like ```26.253.167.206```. When making web requests, your computer and browser disclose the type of the request, for example <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2228.0 Safari/537.36```.
## Understanding the Significance of Default Gateways

The default gateway is typically an address that is automatically configured via DHCP. When utilizing DHCP, you will receive a default gateway, such as ```192.0.0.46``` (though, they usually end in .1 or .254 based on the scope size), where all of your computer's traffic is routed. For a detailed analysis of ```IPv6```, you can refer to [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/) or inspect on Mac or Linux with: <br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.46    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:e768:1ccd:7925:b7b9%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {164.181.140.43, 181.68.183.249}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr c1:d6:35:0d:0f:79
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr ab:20:0e:40:f8:15
}</pre>




## Solve Problems with Wired and Wireless Connections

When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you might be using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX Users

No matter which version of OSX/macOS you're using - whether it's ```10.11.9```, ```11.4.5```, or ```12.0.7``` - there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts don't provide a set of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting comes into play, especially for teams that are embracing remote work and the Work From Anywhere (WFA) concept.
#### Utilizing Built-in Scripts for Assistance

A very useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump to the CLI of current wireless-related settings and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Moreover, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only relevant to wireless at a single point in time, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz``` for you. If you prefer to run it *interactively*, you can execute ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will then give a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` or use Finder with Cmd+Shift+G to point Finder to the path. Be cautious of the file sizes, as they are typically around 300MB.
