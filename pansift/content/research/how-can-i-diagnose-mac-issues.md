## Understanding Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned either a Public IPv4 like ```15.231.126.220``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:33a7:521b:500b:70f4:21c5:ef92:ebbe```. You can verify this information by visiting [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, communicating or referencing these addresses to non-technical individuals, or even MAC addresses such as ```0d:ed:0a:11:50:1e```, can quickly become complex and error-prone. Moreover, it does not provide historical data from past issues.
## The Process of Accessing the Internet

In order to visit a website like https://mosciski-murphy.biz, your computer first contacts a DNS server to convert the host name (mosciski-murphy) combined with the Top Level Domain (biz) of the URL into an IP address such as ```111.122.145.114```. Additionally, your computer and browser include specific information with each web request, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; AOL 9.7; AOLBuild 4343.19; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; FunWebProducts)```
## The Significance of Default Gateways

Your default gateway is usually an automatically assigned address through DHCP. It typically looks like ```192.0.0.200``` (commonly ending in .1 or .254 based on the scope size) and serves as the route for all outgoing traffic from your computer. For those interested in troubleshooting IPv6 connectivity, there is an in-depth guide available at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). On Mac or Linux, you can verify this information with the following command: <br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.200    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:42db:9ca:3a95:6559%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {221.110.15.83, 16.193.41.248}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 0d:ed:0a:11:50:1e
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 7e:7b:37:7f:ac:97
}</pre>




## Fixing Connectivity Issues for Wired and Wireless Networks

When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you might be using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX Users
Regardless of whether you are using OSX/macOS ```10.11.6```, ```11.4.2```, or ```12.2.9```, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a set of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, especially for teams that support remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Effective Built-in Scripts
One valuable tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of the current wireless settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is specific to wireless and similar to wdutil.

To run it in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` which will give a privacy warning. The generated logs can be found in the ```/var/tmp``` directory or by using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G to locate the path. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
