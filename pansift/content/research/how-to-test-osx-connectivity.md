## Understanding Internet Addressing

When connected to the Internet, an individual might receive a Public IPv4 address, such as ```39.58.228.43```, or an IPv6 address, like ```2000:5947:7f35:c054:93e1:542d:4a9e:9ac6```. The address can be checked from [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, for those not well-versed in technology, communicating these addresses or MAC addresses like ```14:24:d0:e1:e6:76``` can be prone to errors and quickly become complex. Moreover, this method does not provide any historical data, particularly from past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web
When attempting to access a webpage, such as https://reynolds.net, the process begins with contacting a DNS server to translate the host portion "reynolds" combined with the Top Level Domain "net" of the URL to an IP address like ```90.45.222.192```. Each web request from your computer and browser includes its type, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_3) AppleWebKit/537.75.14 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/7.0.3 Safari/7046A194A```
## The Significance of Default Gateways
The default gateway is typically an address that is automatically configured via DHCP. An example of the default gateway is ```192.0.0.10```, with addresses usually ending in .1 or .254 based on the scope size, where the computer routes all its traffic. For more information on setting up ```IPv6``` connectivity, a comprehensive guide is available at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). On Mac or Linux, verification can be done using the following command:

### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.10    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:d8ca:1934:db77:6b09%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {86.148.242.216, 244.251.28.228}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 14:24:d0:e1:e6:76
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 37:06:fc:2e:aa:ad
}</pre>




## Fixing Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections
When it comes to sending data to your router, you might be using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of which version of OSX/macOS you have, whether it's ```10.12.2```, ```11.3.7```, or ```12.2.6```, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a set of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting comes in handy, especially for teams that adopt remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
One of the helpful tools on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI, and can be configured to generate specific troubleshooting logs. In addition, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only relevant to wireless settings, similar to wdutil.

To run ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```. Alternatively, you can run ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` interactively, which will prompt a privacy warning and open Finder in the correct location. Be mindful of the file sizes, which can be around 300MB or more.
