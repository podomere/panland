## Understanding Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, individuals may receive a Public IPv4 or IPv6 address. These addresses can be verified using [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, communicating these addresses, or even identifying MAC addresses, can become challenging and error-prone for those who are not technologically inclined. Moreover, it does not provide any historical data, especially during past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

Accessing a website such as https://haag-kassulke.co involves initially contacting a DNS server to translate the URL's host portion and Top Level Domain to an IP address. When making web requests, your computer and browser convey their type, such as <br>```Opera/9.80 (X11; Linux i686; Ubuntu/14.10) Presto/2.12.388 Version/12.16```.
## Understanding the Significance of Default Gateways

The default gateway is typically an automatically assigned address via DHCP, such as ```10.152.99.31``` (commonly ending in .1 or .254 based on the scope size). This is where your computer forwards all traffic to be routed. For ```IPv6```, more detailed information is available at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). On Mac or Linux systems, this can be verified using:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  10.152.99.31    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:8919:e599:84e0:f55b%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {92.24.230.5, 107.253.99.161}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr f2:e1:b5:9d:c5:99
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 1a:92:f4:4a:3b:36
}</pre>




## Resolving Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you might be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
No matter the version of OSX/macOS you're using - whether it's 10.11.2, 11.1.1, or 12.1.9 - there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts fail to provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes invaluable, particularly for teams that have embraced remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Utilizing Built-in Scripts for Assistance
One particularly useful tool on OSX/macOS is the `sudo wdutil info`, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the `sysdiagnose` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only relevant to wireless at a specific point in time, similar to wdutil.

Running `sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &` will execute it in the background and write logs to `/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz`. If you prefer to run it *interactively* (although there isn't much interaction), you can use `sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose`, which will prompt a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to `/var/tmp` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Be cautious of the file sizes, which are around 300MB more or less.
