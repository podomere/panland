# Internet Addressing
On the Internet you might get a Public IPv4 address like **109.110.129.113** or an IPv6 address like **9977:66e2:7540:4cee:9195:a1f1:bfeb:7cef**. You can check this from [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). Yet, for 'non-techies' to try and communicate these addresses, or even call out MAC addresses like **79:a1:69:c4:2f:13**, it's error prone and gets complicated quickly. Additionally, this doesn't give you any historical data (especially back when previous problems occured).

# Accessing the Web
To get to a web page like https://ward.net you initially access a DNS server to translate the host portion (ward) combined with the Top Level Domain net of the URL, to an IP address like **108.70.38.190**. 

# Default Gateways
Your default gateway is normally an automatically configured address via DHCP. You get a default gateway like **198.19.38.158** (though they normally end in .1 or .254 depending upon the scope size) and this is where your computer sends all its traffic to be routed onwards. For **IPv6** we have a deep dive on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/).

# Wired or Wireless
At the physical and data layer you may be using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium to send this data towards your router.
