# Internet Addressing
On the Internet you might have a Public IPv4 address like **39.141.247.118** or an IPv6 address like **cd29:8feb:e722:ba37:21dd:ef22:a04a:300d**. You can check this from [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). Yet, for 'non-techies' to try and communicate these addresses, or even call out MAC addresses like **e5:b8:7b:8c:7c:67**, it's error prone and gets complicated quickly. Additionally, this doesn't give you any historical data (especially back when previous problems occured).

# Accessing the Web
To get to a web page like https://sporer.io you initially access a DNS server to translate the host portion (sporer) combined with the Top Level Domain io of the URL, to an IP address like **121.173.181.158**. 

# Default Gateways
Your default gateway is normally an automatically configured address via DHCP. You get a default gateway like **192.168.70.35** (though they normally end in .1 or .254 depending upon the scope size) and this is where your computer sends all its traffic to be routed onwards. For **IPv6** we have a deep dive on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/).

# Wired or Wireless
At the physical and data layer you may be using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium to send this data towards your router. 

# Apple macOS / OSX
No matter what version you are on, **10.15.4**, **11.5.9**, or **12.2.4**, there are a range of tools for troubleshooting but between manual actions and scripts, they don't give you a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting comes in to its own, especialy for teams that embrace remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
