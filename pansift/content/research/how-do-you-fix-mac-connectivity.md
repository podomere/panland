## Understanding Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned a unique IPv4 or IPv6 address, such as ```236.90.227.195``` or ```2000:ea49:b5d8:9da8:18e5:11cd:218a:4731```. You can verify this information by visiting [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, explaining and using these addresses or MAC addresses like ```46:24:f4:3f:49:d2``` can become complex, especially for those without technical expertise. Furthermore, this method does not provide any historical data, particularly when past issues occurred.
## Navigating the World Wide Web
When accessing a website such as https://huel.io, your computer first connects to a DNS server to convert the website's host (huel) and Top Level Domain (io) to an IP address, like ```84.102.135.33```. Moreover, your computer and browser include their specifics in all web requests, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; AOL 9.7; AOLBuild 4343.19; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; FunWebProducts)```
## The Significance of Default Gateways
The default gateway is usually automatically assigned through DHCP and manifests as an address like ```172.22.218.141``` (typically ending in .1 or .254, depending on the scope size). This is the point where your computer forwards all its traffic for routing. For ```IPv6```, we offer an in-depth guide at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), or you can verify on Mac or Linux using the following command:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  172.22.218.141    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:2241:13ef:3879:5a7c%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {96.80.98.174, 149.9.166.113}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 46:24:f4:3f:49:d2
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 15:4e:81:ee:0f:de
}</pre>




## Troubleshooting Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections

When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Effective Solutions for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of whether you are using OSX/macOS version ```10.14.3```, ```11.5.2```, or ```12.0.4```, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, despite the availability of manual actions and scripts, they do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting comes in handy, particularly for teams that are adopting remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Utilizing Built-in Scripts for Assistance
One extremely useful tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can also be configured to create specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only relevant to wireless settings, similar to wdutil.

To run ```sysdiagnose``` in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, you can use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, but beware of the large file sizes, which are approximately 300MB or more.
