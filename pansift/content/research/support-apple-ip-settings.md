## Understanding Internet Address Allocation

When connecting to the Internet, you're assigned a public IPv4 address, such as ```24.109.41.146```, or an IPv6 address like ```2000:6f42:fd64:cad:5993:ef54:472a:dd2b```. This information can be verified at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, explaining and sharing these addresses with individuals who are not tech-savvy can be prone to errors and quickly become complex. Moreover, it lacks historical data, especially for previous issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

When trying to access a website like https://little.com, your initial step is to contact a DNS server to convert the host part (little) along with the Top Level Domain (com) of the URL into an IP address, for example, ```167.171.254.4```. Furthermore, your computer and browser include its type in all web requests, such as <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT x.y; Win64; x64; rv:10.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0```
## Understanding the Significance of Default Gateways

The default gateway is typically an automatically configured address through DHCP. An example of a default gateway address is ```10.114.44.26``` (although they usually end in .1 or .254 based on the scope size), and this is where your computer sends all its traffic to be routed onwards. For ```IPv6```, detailed information is available on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), and you can verify it on Mac or Linux using:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  10.114.44.26    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:21ea:8047:616d:eb06%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {134.242.146.4, 233.74.247.138}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr e0:99:94:59:a7:3b
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 82:05:99:cf:42:41
}</pre>




## Resolving Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections
When dealing with data transmission at the physical and data layer, you might be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium to transfer the data to your router.
### Effective Solutions for Apple macOS / OSX Users
No matter which version of OSX/macOS you have - whether it's 10.11.6, 11.5.7, or 12.1.6 - there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a set of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes crucial, especially for teams that have embraced remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
One incredibly helpful tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only relevant to wireless at a specific point in time, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` will execute the tool in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```. For an *interactive* run (though there isn't much interaction), you can use ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will display a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. However, be cautious of the file sizes, which are typically around 300MB.
