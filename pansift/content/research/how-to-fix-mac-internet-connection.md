## Understanding Internet Addressing

When using the internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 or IPv6 address, such as ```222.240.247.185``` or ```2000:a300:9c14:5708:89c6:8456:bba6:fc6d```. Verifying this information can be done at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying these addresses to non-technical individuals, or even articulating MAC addresses like ```fd:e2:83:d1:b0:ef```, can quickly become complex and prone to errors. Moreover, this method does not provide historical data, particularly concerning past problems.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

Accessing a webpage, such as https://toy.org, begins with a DNS server translating the host portion (toy) and the Top Level Domain (org) of the URL into an IP address, such as ```166.189.99.162```. Furthermore, your computer and browser communicate their type with all web requests, for example, <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; AS; rv:11.0) like Gecko```.
## The Significance of Default Gateways

Typically, your default gateway is an address configured automatically through DHCP, such as ```10.218.218.71``` (often ending in .1 or .254 based on scope size), and it is where your computer directs all of its traffic to be routed. For ```IPv6```, detailed instructions are available at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), but it can also be verified on Mac or Linux with: <br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  10.218.218.71    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:6de7:f20e:c798:4549%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {185.248.18.161, 172.48.240.233}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr fd:e2:83:d1:b0:ef
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 85:ea:fc:68:d1:50
}</pre>




## Resolve Issues with Wired or Wireless Connections
In the process of sending data to your router, it is essential to troubleshoot or fix issues related to wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) connections at the physical and data layer.
### Solutions for Apple macOS / OSX Problems
No matter which version of OSX/macOS you are using, whether it's ```10.13.9```, ```11.0.5```, or ```12.3.7```, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. While manual actions and scripts are helpful, they do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, especially for teams that are involved in remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Tools for Troubleshooting
An important tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the command line interface and can also be configured to generate specific troubleshooting logs. Furthermore, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although many of them are point-in-time only in relation to wireless, similar to wdutil.

To run ```sysdiagnose``` in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. For an interactive mode (although there is minimal interaction), run ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` and it will display a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
