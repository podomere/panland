In a sea of potential candidates it's imperative that your CV (or profile) surfaces to gain attention when you are job hunting. Often, due to lack of clarity in position descriptions or limited keyword searches, your CV (or profile) may be left out in the cold. Whether you have a `1` or `5` page CV doesn't really matter *if* a hiring team is using simple **Boolean searches** and you _lack_ the exact keywords they are using. 

Additionally their _ATS (Applicant Tracking System)_ may have already categorised you based on keywords which potentially leaves you relegated to a dusty corner of their database.

**Note:** _Boolean_ simply means either _true_ or _false_. So a **Boolean search** just means checking for the _absence_ of _presence_ of a term, keyword, or group thereof. More complex searches may mean looking for something like `A AND B OR C` but essentially, if you don't have exactly the right mix of keywords (or the hiring team have a suboptimal search combination for a role) you may not get over the first hurdle.

## Awesome SEO for your CV
A simple way to optimise your CV for the domain you work in is to _pad_ your CV with as many **legitimate** keywords as you can. Place them at the end of your CV in the smallest font possible (`6` point?). Make sure the text is also **white** so it blends in with the background. When any automated search is performed across a batch of CVs (or the indexes thereof) your CV has a much better chance of surfacing for a deeper human review. Don't forget to keep your main skills visible but any extended keyword lists should be invisible to the naked eye!

**Note:** Essentially this is what used to be called _keyword stuffing_ in SEO(Search Engine Optimisation) for the web. Search engines don't explicitly use _meta tags_ any longer to determine content, yet for CVs you can still optimise and increase your chances of being noticed with in-house databases and ATS'.

## Simple Ethics
As long as your keyword list **actually applies** to **your experience** in whatever domain you operate in, there is no problem. The longer the list, the better the search surface whilst not being aesthetically off-putting for humans. Think of it as moving an unsightly list to a smaller corner of your CV (which is _machine readable_) so you can focus on telling the more human story about the impact you've made in each of your roles :)

## Easy Countermeasures
Irrespective of whether you use keyword stuffing or not, if a hiring team uses a technical screen such as [Simulation Based Screening](https://pansift.com/howitworks?utm_source=psblog&utm_medium=hyperlink&utm_campaign=launch&utm_content=sbs) then you better be `100%` honest and up-to-date on all the skills you list!!
