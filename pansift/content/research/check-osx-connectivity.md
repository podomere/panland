## Explanation of Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, individuals may have a Public IPv4 address such as ```144.126.20.135``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:b42:2062:5341:1cf9:62f:7c48:4fdd```. Verification of this information can be done at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). Communicating these addresses, or even referring to MAC addresses like ```64:9f:12:8d:c4:d7```, can be prone to errors and quickly becomes complex. Furthermore, historical data is not readily accessible, especially when dealing with past issues.
## How Web Pages are Accessed

In order to access a web page like https://wilderman-schneider.org, the first step is to contact a DNS server to convert the combination of the host portion (wilderman-schneider) and the Top Level Domain (org) of the URL into an IP address such as ```142.61.19.163```. Each web request from your computer and browser includes information about its type, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; AS; rv:11.0) like Gecko```
## Significance of Default Gateways

The default gateway is typically an address automatically configured via DHCP. An ordinary default gateway may appear as ```192.168.174.169``` (although they often end with .1 or .254, depending on the scope size) and serves as the point to which your computer forwards all its traffic for routing. A more detailed explanation on ```IPv6``` can be found at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), and on Mac or Linux, it can be verified with: <br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.168.174.169    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:3441:50:a53:b7b8%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {63.235.214.213, 31.59.34.246}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 64:9f:12:8d:c4:d7
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 80:b6:69:83:02:26
}</pre>




## Fixing Connectivity Issues: Wired vs Wireless
When it comes to the physical and data layer, you have the option to use either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium to transmit data to your router.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
No matter which version of OSX/macOS you are currently using - whether it's ```10.12.3```, ```11.0.8```, or ```12.2.5``` - there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes essential, especially for teams that adopt remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
A very useful tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only relevant to wireless at a specific point in time, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz``` for you. For an *interactive* run (though there isn't much interaction), you can use ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will prompt a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, and you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` or use Finder with Cmd+Shift+G to locate the path. Just be cautious of the file sizes, which are approximately 300MB.
