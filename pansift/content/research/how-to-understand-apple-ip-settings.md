## Functioning of Internet Addressing

When using the internet, you will be assigned either a Public IPv4 address, such as ```233.218.73.76```, or an IPv6 address, for example, ```2000:dca:b853:f2a3:f6b3:4169:7cb5:6731```. This information can be verified on [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, attempting to convey these addresses or MAC addresses, such as ```35:1f:4a:fa:93:c4```, can be prone to errors and can quickly become complicated for those not technologically inclined. Moreover, this method does not provide any historical data, particularly when issues arose in the past.
## Navigating the Internet
To access a web page like https://greenholt.io, the first step is to access a DNS server in order to translate the host portion (greenholt) combined with the Top Level Domain (io) of the URL to an IP address, such as ```243.17.121.54```. Additionally, your computer and browser includes its type with all web requests, for example, ```Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_3) AppleWebKit/537.75.14 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/7.0.3 Safari/7046A194A```.
## Significance of Default Gateways
By default, your gateway is typically an automatically configured address via DHCP. This gateway is usually assigned an address like ```192.0.0.197``` (although they generally end in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size) and is where your computer sends all its traffic to be routed onwards. For ```IPv6```, a comprehensive guide is available on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), but you can also verify this on Mac or Linux using:

```bash
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.197    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:1b02:b6de:4b8a:8a58%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {100.40.58.222, 158.32.96.193}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 35:1f:4a:fa:93:c4
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr f5:1a:68:ba:4a:47
}</pre>




## Resolve Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections
Whether you are connected via a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer, troubleshooting connection issues with your router is essential.
### Step-by-Step Guide for Apple macOS / OSX Users
No matter if you are running version ```10.15.2```, ```11.6.7```, or ```12.2.4``` of OSX/macOS, there are various tools available for resolving connectivity problems. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a set of interconnected values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, especially for teams that prioritize remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Utilize Pre-Installed Scripts for Assistance
An effective tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which displays current wireless settings in the CLI and can also create specific logs for troubleshooting. Another comprehensive tool is the ```sysdiagnose``` tool, which generates a wide range of logs (although much of it is relevant to wireless settings only, similar to wdutil).

To run ```sysdiagnose``` in the background and generate logs in ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, but beware of the large file sizes of about 300MB.
