## Understanding Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address, such as ```140.9.156.173```, or an IPv6 address, like ```2000:ce77:914b:ba2a:6bab:2dc0:4858:ecdd```. To verify these addresses, you can visit [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, relaying these addresses, or MAC addresses like ```00:a6:2c:f0:3e:64```, may become error-prone and complicated, particularly for individuals not well-versed in technology. Moreover, historical data, especially from past issues, is not provided.
## Navigating the World Wide Web
Accessing a webpage such as https://braun.com involves initially reaching a DNS server to translate the combination of the host portion (braun) and the Top Level Domain (com) of the URL to an IP address, such as ```30.89.86.80```. With every web request, your computer and browser indicate its type, e.g., <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; AOL 9.7; AOLBuild 4343.19; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; FunWebProducts)```.
## Significance of Default Gateways
The default gateway is typically an automatically configured address through DHCP. You are assigned a default gateway, such as ```192.168.26.163``` (often ending in .1 or .254 based on scope size), to which your computer directs all its traffic for routing. A comprehensive guide on ```IPv6``` connectivity in Mac or Linux is available at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/).

### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.168.26.163    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:1c8d:3b6a:d0e3:dad3%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {249.94.254.5, 153.208.253.13}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 00:a6:2c:f0:3e:64
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 3e:eb:ab:50:0f:5e
}</pre>




## Fixing Connection Issues for Wired and Wireless Networks
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of whether you are using OSX/macOS ```10.12.3```, ```11.4.3```, or ```12.1.8```, there are a variety of tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, especially for teams that operate remotely and embrace Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Utilizing Built-in Scripts for Assistance
One helpful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only relevant to wireless settings, similar to wdutil.

To run sysdiagnose in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, use the command```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will give a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
