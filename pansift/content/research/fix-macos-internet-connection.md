## The Functionality of Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned a unique Public IPv4 address such as ```20.30.46.195``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:d922:fae:27cc:223c:53b9:e44e:97b5```. These addresses can be verified at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying these addresses to individuals who are not technologically savvy, or discussing MAC addresses like ```4e:55:1c:ff:79:04``` can be prone to errors and quickly become complex. Additionally, this method does not offer any historical data (especially when past issues arise).
## Navigating the Internet

In order to access a website such as https://kassulke.co, you first access a DNS server to translate the combination of the host portion (kassulke) and the Top Level Domain (co) of the URL into an IP address, such as ```97.33.99.76```. Your computer and browser communicate their type with all web requests, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2228.0 Safari/537.36```
## The Significance of Default Gateways

The default gateway is typically an address that is automatically configured via DHCP. You are assigned a default gateway such as ```10.105.69.42``` (though they generally end in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size), and this is where your computer sends all of its traffic to be routed onward. For ```IPv6```, we provide an in-depth analysis on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), but you can also check on Mac or Linux using: <br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  10.105.69.42    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:3e22:a58b:acaf:9d4b%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {99.75.141.105, 74.154.153.169}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 4e:55:1c:ff:79:04
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 80:d0:45:17:1d:f2
}</pre>




## Fixing Connectivity Issues for Wired and Wireless Networks

When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you might be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
Whether you're running OSX/macOS version ```10.14.8```, ```11.6.6```, or ```12.1.1```, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes essential, particularly for teams that support remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA) arrangements.
#### Utilizing Built-in Scripts
A useful tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which dumps the current wireless settings to the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Furthermore, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool is more comprehensive and can generate a wide array of logs, although many of these are point-in-time only in relation to wireless, similar to wdutil.

To run it in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. For an interactive run, use ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` and follow the privacy warning. The file sizes are approximately 300MB, so be aware of this when running the tool.
