## Understanding Internet Address Formats

When using the Internet, there are two main types of addresses: IPv4 and IPv6. A public IPv4 address looks like ```133.149.143.196```, while an IPv6 address is formatted as ```2000:4301:12af:7d46:596e:fc63:f864:f7b5```. These can be verified through the [test-ipv6 website](https://test-ipv6.com/). Communicating these addresses or MAC addresses like ```62:55:d5:35:43:45``` can be complex and error-prone, especially for those not well-versed in technology. Additionally, it does not provide any historical data regarding past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

When accessing a website such as https://kautzer.name, the first step is to contact a DNS server. The DNS server translates the host portion (kautzer) combined with the Top Level Domain (name) of the URL into an IP address, such as ```171.244.76.54```. Additionally, your computer and browser send its type with all web requests, such as <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; AS; rv:11.0) like Gecko```.
## The Significance of Default Gateway

The default gateway is an address automatically configured via DHCP. It typically appears as ```192.0.0.2``` (though it usually ends in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size). This is where your computer sends all its traffic to be routed onwards. For ```IPv6```, more detailed information can be found in our blog post, [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). On Mac or Linux, you can check this with the following command:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.2    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:bd6d:2a12:d47d:e56%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {245.175.114.223, 189.240.25.14}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 62:55:d5:35:43:45
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 78:7e:46:d4:84:41
}</pre>




## Diagnosing and Resolving Connectivity Issues for Wired and Wireless Networks

When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Methods for Apple macOS / OSX
No matter which version of OSX/macOS you have - whether it's 10.12.4, 11.0.4, or 12.0.9 - there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes essential, especially for teams that embrace remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Utilizing Built-in Scripts for Assistance
One extremely useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Furthermore, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a multitude of logs, although much of it is only relevant to wireless networks just like wdutil.

To run it in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, you can use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, but be aware of the large file sizes of about 300MB.
