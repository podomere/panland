## Understanding Internet Addressing

When connecting to the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address such as ```79.154.73.117``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:48e8:fbcd:f117:4d2e:b3d1:5151:b9b```. These addresses can be verified using [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, for those who are not technically inclined, communicating these addresses or MAC addresses like ```36:99:82:72:bb:9f``` can lead to errors and confusion. Furthermore, this method does not provide historical data, particularly when dealing with previous issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web
Accessing a website like https://fahey-strosin.info involves requesting the IP address, such as ```105.142.102.18```, associated with the host portion (fahey-strosin) and the Top Level Domain (info) of the URL from a DNS server. Your computer and browser include its type in all web requests, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2228.0 Safari/537.36```
## The Significance of Default Gateways
The default gateway is usually an automatically assigned address through DHCP. It typically ends in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size, such as ```192.0.0.245```, and serves as the routing point for all traffic from your computer. For ```IPv6```, detailed instructions are available in our [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), and you can verify on Mac or Linux using:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.245    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:4e61:4b92:9ad:d555%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {90.112.183.153, 105.162.252.96}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 36:99:82:72:bb:9f
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 11:c4:52:10:ea:02
}</pre>




## Resolving Connectivity Issues for Wired or Wireless Networks

When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX Systems
Regardless of whether you are running OSX/macOS versions such as ```10.11.3```, ```11.1.3```, or ```12.3.9```, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, especially for teams that embrace remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA) setups.
#### Utilizing Built-in Scripts
A useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of the current wireless settings to the CLI and can generate specific troubleshoot logs. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although it is mostly point-in-time in relation to wireless, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```. Alternatively, running ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` interactively will give a privacy warning and open Finder in the correct location, allowing you to navigate to ```/var/tmp``` or use Finder with Cmd+Shift+G to point to the path. However, be mindful of the file sizes, which are approximately 300MB.
