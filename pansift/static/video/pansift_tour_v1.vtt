00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.284
Welcome to PanSift. This is the dashboard. No

2
00:00:02.284 --> 00:00:04.466
matter where you are located or who you are

3
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:07.055
supporting remotely, you can see real time insights

4
00:00:07.055 --> 00:00:09.491
into their computer's Internet connection, their

5
00:00:09.491 --> 00:00:12.130
local Wi-fi, and other key metrics that affect their

6
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.465
voice and video connectivity or laptop health.

7
00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:16.902
Let's take a look at the most

8
00:00:16.902 --> 00:00:18.443
recent Internet outages.

9
00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.431
By clicking on the insight we are immediately taken

10
00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:25.714
to the issue. Let's zoom in a little and

11
00:00:25.714 --> 00:00:27.655
see what's going on on "laptop 3".

12
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.651
We can see it's not specifically the Internet, as

13
00:00:30.651 --> 00:00:32.298
there was a problem reaching

14
00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:33.592
the local network too.

15
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.859
Here we can see IPv6 and IPv4 failing locally.

16
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.883
We have fast access to the previous

17
00:00:41.883 --> 00:00:43.331
public IP addresses.

18
00:00:43.403 --> 00:00:45.694
But we also notice that ARP was failing

19
00:00:45.694 --> 00:00:47.162
to complete at times too.

20
00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:50.399
With built-in lookups we can also see the vendor's

21
00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.750
organizationally unique identifier to

22
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.975
help with equipment identification.

23
00:00:55.102 --> 00:00:57.390
We can also see the interfaces used by the

24
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.678
default route including the hardware type.

25
00:00:59.732 --> 00:01:02.545
And we can also see the local interface

26
00:01:02.545 --> 00:01:04.853
IPs used during this time range.

27
00:01:04.925 --> 00:01:07.477
At all times, the host details are available

28
00:01:07.477 --> 00:01:09.100
to us on the left hand side.

29
00:01:13.045 --> 00:01:17.001
We can also see the test hosts used for DNS, trace

30
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:20.482
routes, and basic HTTP tests. These hosts are

31
00:01:20.482 --> 00:01:22.855
editable on the paid plan with

32
00:01:22.855 --> 00:01:24.912
up to 5 arbitrary records.

33
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.120
Now let's take a peak at DNS. We actively query the

34
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.033
DNS servers for the test host records, but also do

35
00:01:31.033 --> 00:01:33.945
additional random queries to force full resolution

36
00:01:33.945 --> 00:01:36.159
rather than relying on cached records.

37
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.487
Let's add 30 minutes to either side, to

38
00:01:39.487 --> 00:01:42.144
get a better picture of response times.

39
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.494
Now let's see where in the world this agent's IP

40
00:01:45.494 --> 00:01:48.291
addresses are coming from during this time period.

41
00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:50.640
Our lighthouses reflect back the public IP

42
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.493
addresses, as seen from the agent requests. We give

43
00:01:53.493 --> 00:01:57.353
city level resolution and depending on the ISP's attention to detail,

44
00:01:57.353 --> 00:01:58.863
we can get pretty specific.

45
00:01:59.143 --> 00:02:02.759
In the trace and ASN section, we show, not just

46
00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.079
the hops, but also generate real time, ASNÂ 

47
00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.622
lookups, and also include the AS names. You can

48
00:02:09.622 --> 00:02:13.311
spot changes in hop length, and autonomous system,

49
00:02:13.311 --> 00:02:13.902
rapidly.

50
00:02:14.197 --> 00:02:17.097
These paths are available historically for all your

51
00:02:17.097 --> 00:02:19.599
configured test hosts, which includes either

52
00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.931
IP or ASN paths for easy cut and paste.

53
00:02:22.045 --> 00:02:24.880
Similarly we can see status codes

54
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.371
and baseline speeds for HTTP.

55
00:02:27.457 --> 00:02:30.356
PanSift's agents also allow the missing link, which

56
00:02:30.356 --> 00:02:33.142
is, for a user to add custom notes giving missing

57
00:02:33.142 --> 00:02:35.871
context, during an issue or outage. Even if they

58
00:02:35.871 --> 00:02:38.315
are offline, all notes and measurements are

59
00:02:38.315 --> 00:02:40.418
buffered until the agent syncs again,

60
00:02:40.418 --> 00:02:42.237
via a local network, or hotspot.

61
00:02:42.522 --> 00:02:45.602
Notice that each tab change preserves the current

62
00:02:45.602 --> 00:02:48.682
time window, but if you want to be more specific,

63
00:02:48.682 --> 00:02:51.511
you can specify exact query times quickly and

64
00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:54.654
easily. Additionally, you can even share URL links

65
00:02:54.654 --> 00:02:56.477
with those you invite to view

66
00:02:56.477 --> 00:02:58.174
or administer your account.

67
00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.810
With the explosion in Wi-Fi devices, it's

68
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.415
imperative to understand airtime and channels,

69
00:03:03.415 --> 00:03:06.190
especially in dense environments. PanSift watches

70
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.795
our for weak MCS values and color codes them

71
00:03:08.795 --> 00:03:10.777
showing you when bad signal quality

72
00:03:10.777 --> 00:03:12.589
is causing issues or slow downs.

73
00:03:12.872 --> 00:03:15.366
Pansift is also scanning your local Wi-Fi

74
00:03:15.366 --> 00:03:18.285
environment and records other networks including

75
00:03:18.285 --> 00:03:21.325
what channels, widths, and vendors they are using.

76
00:03:21.325 --> 00:03:24.366
This means you can tell what parts of the airspace

77
00:03:24.366 --> 00:03:27.346
are contended and what RF space is free. PanSift

78
00:03:27.346 --> 00:03:30.447
will even suggest alternate channels for you to use

79
00:03:30.447 --> 00:03:33.123
based upon device supported channels and the

80
00:03:33.123 --> 00:03:35.555
used channels in the current time frame.

81
00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:38.307
So, you can rapidly and instantaneously

82
00:03:38.307 --> 00:03:41.109
troubleshoot Wi-Fi, IP, interfaces, status and

83
00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.852
more, but without having to try and access the

84
00:03:43.852 --> 00:03:46.178
terminal on a remote machine or annoy a

85
00:03:46.178 --> 00:03:48.384
non-technical user. You can see in to

86
00:03:48.384 --> 00:03:50.351
the past right up to the present.

87
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.833
The agent section lets you go direct to any agent

88
00:03:53.833 --> 00:03:57.146
to deep dive when need be. In the background , data

89
00:03:57.146 --> 00:04:00.394
is stored in buckets, and there's a handy guide to

90
00:04:00.394 --> 00:04:03.707
walk you through onboarding agents. From the remote

91
00:04:03.707 --> 00:04:06.435
user perspective an agent install is hands

92
00:04:06.435 --> 00:04:08.514
off and zero touch provisioning.

93
00:04:08.838 --> 00:04:11.513
Well done, you've now got the power to save time,

94
00:04:11.513 --> 00:04:13.914
trouble, and toil while supporting work from

95
00:04:13.914 --> 00:04:16.588
anywhere. Gain the confidence to provide fearless

96
00:04:16.588 --> 00:04:18.935
support! Step through the guide if you need

97
00:04:18.935 --> 00:04:21.227
help and remember to instrument your edge!

98
00:04:21.445 --> 00:04:24.190
Now, try out the one click demo yourself and

99
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.936
install some of the free agents on a problem

100
00:04:26.936 --> 00:04:28.995
machine or in a problem location.
