## Understanding Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you are allocated a unique Public IPv4 address, such as ```179.146.219.73``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:fd1d:f24f:aeee:409b:7958:be7a:1835```. These addresses can be verified by visiting [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying these addresses, or even MAC addresses like ```b2:43:f4:d2:4f:58```, to individuals unfamiliar with technology can be prone to errors and become complex quickly. In addition, it does not provide any historical data, especially when previous issues occurred.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

Accessing a web page, such as https://ledner.net, entails an initial connection to a DNS server to translate the host portion (ledner) combined with the Top Level Domain (net) of the URL into an IP address, such as ```50.84.13.200```. Your computer and browser send their type with all web requests, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; AS; rv:11.0) like Gecko```.
## The Significance of Default Gateways

By default, your gateway address is automatically configured via DHCP. You receive a default gateway, such as ```192.168.146.226``` (typically ending in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size), to which your computer directs all its traffic for routing. For ```IPv6```, in-depth guidance can be found in [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), and such information can be checked on Mac or Linux systems with the following command:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.168.146.226    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:4945:21c1:534d:280c%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {114.162.109.58, 136.103.28.245}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr b2:43:f4:d2:4f:58
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 67:83:0e:4f:30:dc
}</pre>




## Resolving Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections
When it comes to sending data to your router, you might be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of whether your version of OSX/macOS is ```10.11.7```, ```11.1.2```, or ```12.2.4```, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, especially for teams that embrace remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Utilizing Built-in Scripts
A useful tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of the current wireless related settings in the CLI and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Moreover, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a comprehensive range of logs (although much of it is point in time only in relation to wireless, similar to wdutil).

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz``` for you. If you prefer to run it *interactively* (although there is very little interaction), you can run ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` and it will display a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` or use Finder with Cmd+Shift+G to direct Finder to the path. Take note of the file sizes, which are approximately 300MB.
