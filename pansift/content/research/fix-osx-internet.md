## Internet Protocol Addressing: A Simplified Explanation

When using the Internet, you will be assigned a Public IPv4 address, such as ```81.202.119.142```, or an IPv6 address like ```2000:1722:e545:f678:d702:d12d:13b9:57a5```. Verifying this information can be done through [this website](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying these addresses to individuals who are not technology-savvy, or even referencing MAC addresses such as ```49:fe:fe:ba:b3:d2```, can be prone to errors and becomes complex quickly. Furthermore, this method does not provide any historical data, especially when trying to address previous issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

Accessing a web page, such as https://roob.org, initially involves connecting to a DNS server to convert the host portion (roob) combined with the Top Level Domain (org) of the URL to an IP address, such as ```94.208.251.143```. When making web requests, your computer and browser transmit their type, for example <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; AS; rv:11.0) like Gecko```.
## The Significance of Default Gateways

By default, your gateway is usually an automatically configured address through DHCP. You receive a default gateway, such as ```172.21.22.2``` (although they typically end in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size), and this is where your computer directs all its traffic to be routed further. To check on Mac or Linux, you can delve deeper into the topic of ```IPv6``` connectivity by visiting [this guide](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/).
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  172.21.22.2    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:9a2:17aa:a150:8a77%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {223.210.31.115, 163.68.130.198}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 49:fe:fe:ba:b3:d2
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 88:c7:47:79:f4:24
}</pre>




## How to Resolve Wired and Wireless Connectivity Issues
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you might be utilizing either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX Users
Regardless of whether you are using OSX/macOS versions such as ```10.12.9```, ```11.0.5```, or ```12.0.2```, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes invaluable, especially for teams that are adopting remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA) practices.
#### Useful Built-in Scripts for Troubleshooting
A highly useful tool for OSX/macOS users is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI, and can also generate specific logs for troubleshooting purposes. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only relevant to wireless settings at a specific point in time, similar to wdutil.

To run ```sysdiagnose``` in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, you can use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will generate a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
