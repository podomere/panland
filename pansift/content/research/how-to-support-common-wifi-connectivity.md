## Functioning of Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, individuals may have a Public IPv4 address such as ```165.113.46.180``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:bae6:3df8:2090:d033:a859:34f5:56a7```. It is possible to verify this by accessing [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, trying to communicate these addresses, or even identifying MAC addresses like ```e9:be:91:27:27:02```, can be fraught with errors for those who are not tech-savvy, and can become complicated quite quickly. Moreover, this method does not provide any historical information, especially when previous problems occurred.
## Navigating the Internet

In order to reach a website such as https://spencer-kuvalis.net, the first step is to access a DNS server to convert the host portion (spencer-kuvalis) along with the Top Level Domain (net) of the URL, into an IP address like ```153.248.121.148```. All web requests sent by your computer and browser also contain its type, for example: <br>```Opera/9.80 (X11; Linux i686; Ubuntu/14.10) Presto/2.12.388 Version/12.16```
## Significance of Default Gateways

The default gateway is usually an automatically assigned address via DHCP, often taking the form of ```192.168.171.103``` (although they typically end in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size). This is where your computer routes all of its traffic. For ```IPv6```, a comprehensive guide can be found at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). On Mac or Linux, this can be verified with the following code:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.168.171.103    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:d092:c1fd:ded4:9723%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {216.213.177.6, 134.53.41.78}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr e9:be:91:27:27:02
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 89:12:83:27:27:8d
}</pre>




## Resolving Issues with Wired or Wireless Connections
When it comes to sending data to your router, you might be using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
No matter which version of OSX/macOS you're running, whether it's ```10.12.1```, ```11.4.5```, or ```12.3.7```, there are various tools available for resolving issues. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time, which is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes invaluable, especially for teams embracing remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Utilizing Built-in Scripts
One particularly useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of the current wireless settings to the command line interface, and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only point-in-time in relation to wireless, similar to wdutil.

To run ```sysdiagnose``` in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, you can use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, but be aware of the large file sizes of about 300MB.
