# Internet Addressing
On the Internet you may get a Public IPv4 address like **204.197.242.147** or an IPv6 address like **2cf0:372e:a940:f2cc:5e15:c34c:a7ec:9ed3**. We can check this from [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). Yet, for 'non-techies' to try and communicate these addresses, or even call out MAC addresses like **60:47:08:de:fc:28**, it's error prone and gets complicated quickly. Additionally, this doesn't give you any historical data (especially back when previous problems occured).

# Accessing the Web
To get to a web page like https://douglas-grady.com you initially access a DNS server to translate the host portion (douglas-grady) combined with the Top Level Domain com of the URL, to an IP address like **161.249.11.49**. 

# Default Gateways
Your default gateway is normally an automatically configured address via DHCP. You get a default gateway like **198.18.170.150** (though they normally end in .1 or .254 depending upon the scope size) and this is where your computer sends all its traffic to be routed onwards. For **IPv6** we have a deep dive on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/).

# Wired or Wireless
At the physical and data layer you may be using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium to send this data towards your router. 

# Apple macOS / OSX
No matter what version you are on, **10.14.3**, **11.1.2**, or **12.0.4**, there are a range of tools for troubleshooting but between manual actions and scripts, they don't give you a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting comes in to its own, especialy for teams that embrace remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
