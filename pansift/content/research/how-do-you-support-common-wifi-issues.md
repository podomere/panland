# Understanding Internet Protocol Addressing

When utilizing the Internet, you may be assigned a Public IPv4 address such as ```181.0.137.224``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:a822:21d5:8c86:38a9:fcd0:a34:7908```. A simple way to verify this is by visiting the site [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, relaying these addresses to those less experienced in technology, or even referencing MAC addresses like ```3f:8d:b5:c9:f2:13```, can be prone to mistakes and quickly becomes complex. Furthermore, this method does not provide any historical data, particularly from past occurrences.
## Navigating the World Wide Web
Accessing a website such as https://halvorson.com initially involves contacting a DNS server to translate the host aspect (halvorson) combined with the Top Level Domain (com) of the URL to an IP address, such as ```228.82.47.39```. Interestingly, upon sending web requests, your computer and browser also convey their type, for instance: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; AOL 9.7; AOLBuild 4343.19; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; FunWebProducts)```
## The Significance of Default Gateways
Typically configured automatically by DHCP, your default gateway is assigned an address like ```172.29.152.26``` (although they generally conclude with .1 or .254 based on the scope size). This is the location where your computer directs all of its traffic to be routed. If you wish to delve deeper into the topic with regards to ```IPv6```, you can refer to our detailed guide on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). Alternatively, you can verify this on Mac or Linux using the following command:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  172.29.152.26    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:6a4c:11ac:2b93:3fc0%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {15.188.218.4, 9.5.246.56}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 3f:8d:b5:c9:f2:13
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 07:16:46:c8:23:14
}</pre>




## Solutions for Wired and Wireless Connectivity Issues
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may encounter connectivity issues at the physical and data layer, whether you are using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX Users
Regardless of which version of OSX/macOS you are using, whether it's ```10.14.4```, ```11.2.8```, or ```12.2.8```, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual methods and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where the need for automated remote troubleshooting arises, particularly for teams that are adapting to remote work and embracing the concept of Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
One of the useful tools on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although most of the information is only point-in-time in relation to wireless, similar to wdutil.

To run it in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, use ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, but be aware that it will give a privacy warning. The file sizes are approximately 300MB, so keep that in mind.
