title: 11 Tips and Tactics to Get Hired
---

## 1. The Noise Problem

The Internet (*and* moreso the Web) is full of noise and so are most people's minds. Remember this when you are trying to get a signal through to someone, especially via digital means! 

- [x] Hiring teams are busy identifying signal both inside and outside of their own organizational footprint. 
- [x] There's a hiring funnel and you need to get in it so don't fail at the first hurdle. You have to capture attention of **both** humans and machines in most cases. 
- [x] Your signal will go further if it's stronger and comes from more directions (multipath) with a minimum pincer manoeuvre i.e. come at it from 2 directions or contact via a minimum of 2 means. 
- [x] It's both what you know and who you know (or who you can get to know) so try to get in touch with the right people (see above). 
- [x] Whether you are extrovert or introvert get involved in community groups  related to your target domain (online and offline) and deepen your network, connections, contacts, and knowledge.  
  
## 2. The Underlay Problem

- [x] Your CV is a piece of marketing literature and self-written (thus on shaky ground to begin with)
- [x] Most defaults are now to distrust CVs as people realize they are broken tokens
- [x] How can you actually prove your experience in advance of or during an interview?
- [x] You are trying to overcome your own bias and that of others, this is a hard problem
- [x] The gendered [Confidence Gap](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/05/the-confidence-gap/359815/) 
- [x] The language you use is important and meaningful (see Marketing)
- [x] Typos, misspellings, and bad grammar reflect badly (x2) for engineering roles, as it reflects your attention to detail, ability to double check, and level of professional writing and communication in the target language  
  
## 3. The Portfolio Problem

- [x] Show don't tell, can you actually show something or let them see and interact with something you've built? No? Build something.
- [x] Have you got any video of yourself communicating or presenting? Open to a hiring person's bias but better than nothing.
- [x] Is all your work 'Commercial in Confidence', well then you better try to make something with no strings you can show people (see above).  
  
## 4. The Search Problem

- [x] Hiring tools, platforms, and webapps are not smart enough, yet. You can effectively SEO(Search Engine Optimize) your CV, as most just use simple and limited Boolean Search including tools like [https://recruitin.net/](https://recruitin.net/) and [LinkedIn Search](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/75814/using-boolean-search-on-linkedin).
- [x] Even the new age of machine learning and so called hiring A.I. is built on tainted datasets which are optimizing by what ever "words" they electively wrote on their CV and many don't take in to account which CVs were successful for which roles.
- [x] Also the Job Description or Position Description that becomes the Job Advertisement is often inaccurate and itself just marketing literature (see above).
- [x] So an A.I. is being trained and matching on, or fitting to an incorrect incomplete Job Description tied to a self-written marketing flyer written by a self-interested party in a competitive landscape.  
  
## 5. Ingestion Process

- [x] Ask yourself how your CV makes it to the eyes of the hiring manager? Map it. Now hack it, ethically.
- [x] Is it going direct via email to a recruiter, sourcer, or the hiring manager... or is it going via an upload on a web based form?  
  
## 6. CV and Résumé Format

- [x] Short, sharp, and sweet - as a human recruiter will parse your CV "flyer" in less than 20 seconds on first glance and a machine will do it in microseconds to seconds
- [x] This is a sales pitch in a competitive landscape, treat it as such.  
  
## 7. ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) Keywords

- [x] If they already have your CV you want it to resurface as often as possible when keywords are searched for open roles
- [x] Skills surface. Maximize it, ethically. You can invisibly keyword stuff as long as they are valid. The machine will read the text irrespective.  
  
## 8. Recruiters and Sourcers are Human

- [x] Is the recruiter via an agency versus in-house? Why does it matter, well, what are they incentivized on and how?
- [x] Are they playing the volume game?
- [x] Are they reformatting your CV? Are they actually sending through your cover letter?
- [x] Few actually act as your "agent" so don't deceive yourself that they are in there advocating or selling on your behalf as you might imagine.
- [x] Own your own outcomes. Manage your recruiter and set and agree bi-directional expectations and communication timelines.  
  
## 9. Prime the Hiring Manager

- [x] You really want the hiring manager to know your name in advance and be asking for your details or expecting them.
- [x] The hiring manager and hiring team should hear your name from multiple sources in terms of internal employees so shake the tree, nicely. Get in touch with as many people you know there (or could get in touch with) to find out what it's like to work there. 
  
## 10. Referrals and Referees

- [x] Best way to get your CV seen and increase the time spent by the hiring team reviewing it is via referrals. You have to invest to gain social capital you can then spend. See the point about community (on and offline).
- [x] Non-zero sum games (especially if there's a finders fee/bonus) work well, if someone stands to gain to have you possibly come on board.
- [x] The downside can be hiring in clusters or tribes creating homogeneity. Try and discern this early in your investigations.
- [x] References and referees only matter in the later stages or during character checks.
- [x] Always say "References on request". Everyone know's you've picked affirming people.
  
## 11. Research is Important Because...

- [x] Find people in the organisation or 2-3 degree deep connections to them, and get in touch.
- [x] Get their emails via lead gen and email enrichment tools if you must.  
  
> If you want this job, you need to work for it, not point and shoot and wait. Get off your ass and through *your* actions (not others) collapse down the multiverse to the one with the greatest probability of you getting in to, and as far down the funnel as you can, ethically!
