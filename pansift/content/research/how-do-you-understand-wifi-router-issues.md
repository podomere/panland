## Understanding Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned a public IPv4 or IPv6 address. These addresses can be checked using tools like [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, communicating these addresses and MAC addresses to non-technical individuals can be challenging and prone to errors, especially when needing historical data.
## Navigating the Internet

Accessing a website involves translating the URL to an IP address through a DNS server. Additionally, web requests include information about the computer and browser type. For example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_3) AppleWebKit/537.75.14 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/7.0.3 Safari/7046A194A```
## The Significance of Default Gateway

The default gateway, usually obtained through DHCP, is where all traffic is routed onwards. Default gateways typically end with .1 or .254, depending on the scope size. For ```IPv6```, troubleshooting steps can be found at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), and can be checked on Mac or Linux systems.
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  172.20.151.252    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:23b5:4dae:9566:25fa%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {171.97.104.146, 185.155.244.193}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 90:11:09:68:c2:91
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 69:fe:3a:4f:61:b0
}</pre>




## Solve Problems with Wired and Wireless Networks
When it comes to transferring data to your router, you may be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of the version of OSX/macOS you are using, whether it's ```10.15.1```, ```11.5.6```, or ```12.1.9```, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, especially for teams that embrace remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Utilize the Following Built-in Scripts
An extremely useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of the current wireless related settings to the command line interface (CLI). This command can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only relevant to wireless settings, similar to what wdutil provides.

To run the sysdiagnose tool in the background and generate logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, you can use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will open Finder in the correct location or allow you to navigate to ```/var/tmp```. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
