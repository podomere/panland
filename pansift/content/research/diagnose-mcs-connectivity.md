## Understanding Internet Address Allocation

When you are connected to the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address such as ```225.220.134.27``` or an IPv6 address such as ```2000:1e08:80e2:10e5:a833:c32c:380f:d8eb```. Verifying this information is possible through [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, for those who are not technically inclined, conveying or even recognizing these addresses, or even citing MAC addresses like ```69:4f:04:0b:00:1a```, can become prone to errors and become complex quickly. Furthermore, this method does not provide any historical data (especially for past issues).
## Navigating the Internet's Resources

To access a webpage like https://hilll.org, you first connect to a DNS server to convert the hostname (hilll) combined with the Top Level Domain (org) of the URL into an IP address like ```104.236.230.30```. Your computer and browser share their type with all web requests e.g. <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT x.y; Win64; x64; rv:10.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0```
## The Significance of Default Gateways

Your default gateway is typically an address that is automatically configured via DHCP. An example of a default gateway is ```172.16.109.12``` (usually ending in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size). This is the point where your computer routes all of its traffic. For ```IPv6```, more detailed information can be found in [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), but it can be checked on Mac or Linux with: <br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  172.16.109.12    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:d69e:e6a7:2ea0:7bbf%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {162.6.232.162, 11.191.245.37}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 69:4f:04:0b:00:1a
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr c7:65:a3:d0:24:d5
}</pre>




## Resolving Issues with Wired and Wireless Connectivity
When it comes to sending data to your router, you may be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Steps for Addressing Problems on Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of whether you are using OSX or macOS versions such as ```10.14.8```, ```11.1.9```, or ```12.0.8```, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these tools and manual actions do not provide a set of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes essential, particularly for teams that are engaged in remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
One useful tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which dumps current wireless settings to the CLI and can also generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Furthermore, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool provides a wide range of logs, although much of it pertains to wireless settings at a specific point in time, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` will execute the tool in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```. If you prefer to run it *interactively* (even though there is minimal interaction), you can use ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` with a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` or use Finder with Cmd+Shift+G to access the path. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
