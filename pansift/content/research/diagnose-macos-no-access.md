## The Functionality of Internet Addressing 

When using the Internet, you are assigned either a Public IPv4 address, such as ```253.52.138.97```, or an IPv6 address, like ```2000:66b9:f657:2a24:90e1:39b3:17d2:2bce```. You can verify these addresses by visiting [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, when trying to relay these addresses to individuals who are not knowledgeable in technology, or even mentioning MAC addresses, such as ```a6:7a:79:cf:3e:03```, errors can easily occur and the process becomes complicated. Furthermore, this method does not provide any historical data, especially regarding past issues.
## Navigating the Internet
In order to access a website like https://kulas.co, you first connect to a DNS server to convert the host portion (kulas) along with the Top Level Domain (co) of the URL into an IP address, such as ```220.26.138.118```. Your computer and browser also transmit their types with every web request, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; AS; rv:11.0) like Gecko```
## The Significance of Default Gateways
Your default gateway is typically an address that is automatically configured through DHCP. It can be something like ```192.0.0.170``` (although they usually end in .1 or .254, depending on the scope size), and serves as the destination where your computer sends all its traffic to be routed further. For ```IPv6```, detailed instructions can be found in our blog post titled [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), or you can verify on Mac or Linux by using:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.170    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:6832:ef94:389:353d%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {39.184.137.155, 237.132.196.239}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr a6:7a:79:cf:3e:03
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 6b:e0:09:9d:c0:86
}</pre>




## Resolving Connectivity Issues for Wired or Wireless Networks

When it comes to transferring data to your router, you have the option of using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layers.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX Users
Regardless of whether you are using OSX/macOS versions like ```10.13.1```, ```11.2.4```, or ```12.1.4```, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes invaluable, especially for teams that are embracing remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Tools for Troubleshooting
An extremely valuable tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI, and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only relevant to wireless settings at a specific point in time, similar to wdutil.

To run ```sysdiagnose``` in the background and save logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` (which will display a privacy warning). When not run in the background, it should open Finder to the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` manually or by using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Keep in mind that the file sizes will be approximately 300MB or slightly more.
