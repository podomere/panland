title: '11 Tips, Tricks, and Tactics to Get Hired'
---
The Internet (*and* more so the Web) is full of noise. People's minds are constantly bombarded and they struggle to decode clear and actionable signals. Remember this when you are trying to get **your signal** through...

## 1. The Noise Problem

- [x] Hiring teams are busy identifying signals from both inside and outside of their own organizations.
- [x] There's a hiring funnel and you need to get in to it. Don't fail at the first hurdle. You have to capture the attention of **not just** humans **but** also machines too. 
- [x] Your signal will go further if it's **stronger** and comes from multiple directions (multipath). At a minimum use the [pincer manoeuvre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pincer_movement) and come at a hiring team from **2** directions (or via a minimum of **2** mediums). Just like in sales, the more priming and conceptual *touches* (**3x-8x**) that you can muster without annoying people, the more mind share you get for subsequent engagement or interviews. Reinforcement of your name being heard or read frequently (in a good context of course) is desirable.
- [x] Don't ever fool yourself, you are **selling** a part of yourself; your time, your expertise, your energy, and your life. You are renting out your labour and/or mind amidst a **competitive** landscape. Your CV is your personal advertisement and it must leverage more than just psychology to be seen let alone heard.
- [x] Whether you are an extrovert or introvert, get involved in community groups related to your target domain (either online and/or offline) and deepen your network, connections, contacts, and knowledge. 
- [x] Give away knowledge and energy to those communities without any expectation of receiving anything back. You'll be a better person for it. If there's no existing community to be found, build it yourself.
- [x] Don't ever try to game or exploit communities. Yet the more you give, the more you learn and the more well-known you will *likely* become. This renown should be an altruistic byproduct not an engineered goal. At a minimum, you might have more interesting things to put on your CV or talk about in interviews. Let's call this a form of enlightened self-interest.
  
  
## 2. The Underlay Problem

- [x] Your CV is a piece of marketing literature. It is self-written. You are on shaky ground to begin with unless you are a marketing guru and sales champion who knows their audience and their preferred medium intimately. So, become a temporary marketing expert, sales champion, and intimately know both your audience and medium.
- [x] Many hiring teams default to **distrust CVs** as people realize they are **[broken tokens](https://pansift.com/blog/why-cvs-and-resumes-are-broken/)** yet are still our least worst common currency. This is an open secret.
- [x] How can you actually prove your experience in advance of, or during an interview? This is your nut to crack or theirs to test you with. Apart from your attitude everything else is a vague and opaque approximation of condensed [Kabuki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabuki) theatre. 
- [x] The gendered [Confidence Gap](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/05/the-confidence-gap/359815/) is ongoing and pronounced. Confidence does not equal competence.
- [x] You are trying to overcome your own bias and that of others, this is a hard problem, don't give up. Language is important. Use it well and pay attention to theirs.
  
  
## 3. The Portfolio Problem (Proof of Experience)

- [x] Show don't tell. Can you actually show something or let them see and interact with something you've built? No? Build something. This is one reason why [FLOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) is good.
- [x] Have you got any video of yourself communicating or presenting? Video is also vulnerable to a hiring person's bias but it's better than having nothing. The benefits outweigh the drawbacks in terms of showing how you present and communicate. This favours extroverts but perhaps you could give a lightening talk at a local meetup group (and ask a friend to record it).
- [x] Is all your work 'Commercial in Confidence'? Well then, you better try to make or write up something outside of your work that you can share and show people (don't forget [#1](/blog/11-tips-tricks-and-tactics-to-get-hired/#1-the-noise-problem)).
  
    
## 4. The Ingestion Process

- [x] Is your CV going direct via email to a recruiter, sourcer, or the hiring manager? Or is it going via an upload on a web based form and being scraped for text and details?
- [x] Ask yourself how your CV makes it to the eyes of the hiring manager? Map it. Now hack the process, ethically. 
  
  
## 5. The Search Problem

- [x] Hiring platforms and webapps are not smart enough, yet. You can effectively [SEO(Search Engine Optimize)](https://pansift.com/blog/how-to-seo-hack-your-cv/) your CV, as most just use simple and limited **Boolean Search** including [LinkedIn Search](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/75814/using-boolean-search-on-linkedin) and so called 'X-Ray search' from [Recruitin](https://recruitin.net/).
- [x] Algorithms also typically get trained on datasets that contain mostly male language patterns thus reinforcing male characteristics and attributes. Tools like [Textio](https://textio.com/) can help break this cycle by revealing unconscious [gender bias](https://textio.ai/watch-your-gender-tone-2728016066ec) early in **Job Descriptions/Advertisements** (and even in your **CV**).
- [x] Also the **Job Description** or **Position Description** that becomes the **Job Advertisement** is often inaccurate and itself just marketing literature (see above).
- [x] Even the new age of machine learning and so called **A.I.** is built on tainted datasets leading to badly trained algorithms. They use candidate written CV text (and look for simple keywords and keyphrases or use **Natural Language Processing** to extract dates, names, organisations, and skills) and many don't take in to account which CVs were actually successful and for what roles (e.g. to strengthen the algorithms further about succesful applicant characteristics).
- [x] So there are A.I.s being trained on and matching **incorrect and incomplete Job Descriptions** with **candidate's self-written marketing flyers** that were tweaked for competitive landscapes.... hmmmm...

## 6. CV and Résumé Format

- [x] You CV should be short, sharp, and sweet - as a human recruiter may parse your CV '*flyer*' in less than **20 seconds** with their first glance and a machine will do it in microseconds... are you in or out of the funnel? What keywords were they looking for?
- [x] Your CV is a micro sales pitch in a competitive landscape, treat it as such. It's not just a list, you need to optimize for both form and function. 
- [x] Search for and pay attention to advice from people like [Evilrecruiter's: CV Do's and Don'ts](https://www.evilrecruiter.com/cv_advice/) and related privacy [post](https://www.evilrecruiter.com/maintaining-a-semblence-of-privacy-while-looking-for-a-job/)
- [x] Typos, misspellings, and bad grammar are unacceptable when services like automatic spell checkers and tools like [HemingwayApp](https://hemingwayapp.com/) and [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) exist. It's also a total **faux-pas** for engineering roles to have even one character out of place. Errors reflect your level of attention to detail, your ability to double check and enlist help, and of course it shows your professional writing and communication ability in the target language. **Your CV is a piece of marketing literature. A digital billboard for your services and experience**. Your CV is, for all intents and purposes, **you** (until you meet or connect with someone from the hiring team, hopefully IRL(In Real Life)).
- [x] The language you use is important and meaningful. You are conjuring up imagery in the mind of the reader who is screening you. Your CV is also being translated to numbers and is now an algorithmic candidate for a best [fitting curve or spline](https://youtu.be/ajGX7odA87k).
  
  
## 7. ATS (Applicant Tracking System) and Keywords

- [x] If an agency or organisation already has your CV, you want it to **resurface** as often as possible when **keywords** are searched for in relation to open roles
- [x] What is your skills surface? Maximize it, ethically. You can [invisibly keyword stuff](https://pansift.com/blog/how-to-seo-hack-your-cv/) as long as keywords are valid. Software agents and algorithms doing parsing will read the text irrespective and index it.
  
  
## 8. Recruiters and Sourcers are Human

- [x] Is the recruiter representing an agency or is *in-house*? Why does it matter, well, what are they incentivized by and how? What are their KPIs(Key Performance Indicators) and what are their goals? Understand this to understand how they *play* the game.
- [x] Is their strategy **quality** or **quantity**? Are they a cog in a giant machine or actually interested in building up their company's brand with long term relationships? 
- [x] Are they reformatting and repackaging your CV (or even editing it) and then sending it on? Are they actually sending through your cover letter? Has the recruiter "screened" you out already and why? What can you improve upon and what are you missing? Ask for feedback. Call them. Don't just default to email.
- [x] Short term focused recruiters may just be playing the numbers game (or are new at this) but long term focused recruiters *could* place you **2-3** times over a **6-8** year period. You might be worth 20-40K+ to them or even more especially if they can tap **your** professional network too (see [#1](/blog/11-tips-tricks-and-tactics-to-get-hired/#1-the-noise-problem)).
- [x] Recuiters who act as your *agent* are few and far between so don't deceive yourself that they are advocating and selling entirely on your behalf (as you may have imagined).
- [x] Own your own outcomes. Manage your recruiter and set and agree bi-directional expectations and communication timelines.
- [x] Call your recruiter or coordinator frequently to check-in. If you don't have a voice relationship with them, **establish it**. Never rely on digital alone. Reinforce your existence, *frequently*, it's all about **mindshare**.
- [x] Follow up *frequently*. Follow up every **3-4** days unless you've both set a schedule already. Never stop following up until someone tells you to stop. **Use the phone**. Acknowledge with email.
- [x] Again, **use the phone**. This is your **primary** tool not your secondary. If you default to email you are both creating distance **intentionally**.
- [x] Meet your recruiter face-to-face IRL (or at least via a video call). Reinforce you exist as a living breathing person and are not *just* an avatar at the end of an email.
  
  
## 9. Prime the Hiring Manager and Team

- [x] You really want the hiring manager to know your name well in advance. You want them to be asking for your details **themselves** or at least be expecting them as one of the candidates. See [#1](/blog/11-tips-tricks-and-tactics-to-get-hired/#1-the-noise-problem)
- [x] The hiring manager and hiring team should hear your name from multiple sources. It's helpful if internal employees (and/or wider industry circles) have heard of you, so shake the tree a little (*nicely*) and get out there and mix it up a bit! See [#1](/blog/11-tips-tricks-and-tactics-to-get-hired/#1-the-noise-problem)
- [x] Figure out as much as you can about the hiring team and their backgrounds. This allows you to potentially connect on topics of interest or spot connections you were not aware of previously. **Digitally stalking professionals** like this is ok and to be expected.
- [x] It's both **what** you know **and who** you know (or **who** you can **get to know** or **get to know about you**). Try to get in touch with the **right people in the hiring team** sooner rather than later, even to just reasarch the role, company culture, and reality of the situation. 
- [x] Get in touch with any people you know in the organisation (or potentially could get in touch with even if not part of the hiring team) to find out what it's like to actually work there. This also has the benefit of showing you did your research. This is a bonus in interviews as it demonstrates you are a self-starter and can add value by independently researching and evaluating an environment.
- [x] When dealing with anyone in the organisation you are also planting seeds for future engagements and not just this one. Remember that people move organisations and jobs. A person is not just a person, they are also a gateway and represent other clusters, tribes, and new networks. Your communication and name can benefit from unseen network effects so 'always be seeding'. 
  
  
## 10. Referrals, References, and Referees

- [x] The best way to get your CV seen and increase the time spent on it by hiring teams when reviewing it is via referrals. You have to invest time to gain social capital that you can then spend on **1-on-1** requests. See the point about community (both on and offline [#1](/blog/11-tips-tricks-and-tactics-to-get-hired/#1-the-noise-problem)).
- [x] Non-zero sum games work best. If someone internal stands to gain by having you join the organisation (especially if they get a finders fee/referral bonus) they will become your internal champion and contribute to your mindshare.
- [x] The downside of too many referrals can be that of hiring in clusters or tribes that result in homogeneity. Try and discern this early in your investigations. Diversity is strength.
- [x] References and referees only matter in the later stages or as part of final character checks.
- [x] Always write "References on request". Everyone know's you've picked character affirming people yet sometimes these relationship can change or their details or situations change.
  
  
## 11. Important Research

- [x] Find relevant people in the target organisation who you can talk to about the role (even if they are 2-3 degrees away from you on LinkedIn). Get in touch with them via your own contacts (or go hunting as per [#1](/blog/11-tips-tricks-and-tactics-to-get-hired/#1-the-noise-problem) ).
- [x] You can find out or validate people's professional emails via lead generation and email enrichment tools (if need be).
- [x] Do your homework and quickly expose yourself to **new and additional** skills (even if they are listed only as desirable skills). This shows you are willing and able to learn and explore new areas autonomously. Show an interest in keeping up-to-date within your domain (or adjacent ones) and demonstrate self-directed learning with platforms like [Pluralsight](https://pluralsight.pansift.com)
- [x] Arm yourself with as much independent data as you can. Maybe you learn sooner rather than later that you don't actually want this specific role or to be part of this organisation (unless you really have to!).
- [x] During the process of asking questions and connecting with a range of people new opportunities frquently present themselves! You just need to let people know you are looking, that you are open to new things, and ensure you give more than you take!
  
> If you really want this job, you need to work for it. Long gone are the days of point, shoot, and wait. Get off your ass and through *your own actions* (not others) collapse down the multiverse to the one with the greatest probability of you getting as far down the funnel as you can, ethically! **Own your outcomes. Carve your future**.
