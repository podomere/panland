## Understanding Internet Protocol Addressing

When it comes to the internet, you might be assigned a Public IPv4 address such as ```169.28.138.124``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:8810:e853:ea77:d6f8:49e9:805:362f```. Verifying this information can be done at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, for those who are not well-versed in technology, relaying these addresses or MAC addresses such as ```50:d4:64:42:e9:e3``` can lead to errors and unnecessary complexity. Additionally, such information does not provide any historical context, especially when past issues occurred.
## Navigating Through the Internet

When attempting to access a website like https://stracke.org, the first step is to connect with a DNS server to convert the host portion (stracke) along with the Top Level Domain (org) of the URL to an IP address like ```85.236.218.117```. It's worth noting that your computer and browser send their type with every web request, for example: <br>```Opera/9.80 (X11; Linux i686; Ubuntu/14.10) Presto/2.12.388 Version/12.16```.
## The Significance of Default Gateways

By default, your gateway is typically an address that is automatically configured via DHCP. This default gateway could be something like ```192.168.238.202``` (commonly ending in .1 or .254 based on the scope size), and it's where your computer directs all of its traffic to be further routed. For ```IPv6```, a comprehensive guide on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/) is available, but on Mac or Linux, the status can be checked using:

```bash
command-goes-here
```
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.168.238.202    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:e646:c614:9d37:8f18%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {106.233.134.28, 98.251.3.183}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 50:d4:64:42:e9:e3
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr a3:9d:48:26:1a:fb
}</pre>




## Troubleshooting Connectivity Issues for Wired and Wireless Network
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Effective Solutions for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of the version of OSX/macOS you are using, whether it's ```10.11.4```, ```11.6.7```, or ```12.3.4```, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes crucial, especially for teams that are transitioning to remote work and embracing Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
On OSX/macOS, the ```sudo wdutil info``` tool is quite valuable as it provides a dump of the current wireless settings to the Command Line Interface (CLI), and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool is even more comprehensive as it can generate a wide range of logs, although most are point-in-time only in relation to wireless, similar to wdutil.

To run the ```sysdiagnose``` tool in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will give a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
