# Elevator Pitch

PanSift helps tech teams to support Work From Anywhere (WFA). PanSift is all about using real user experience monitoring and then digging in to that data to tell the story of what's going on to fix any issues. It empowers tech teams to do instant and easy troubleshooting to resolve user's issues (especially the opaque network related ones). Reducing toil and a team's Time to Resolution for support issues makes everyone happy, more productive, and frees up staff to focus on more strategic challenges.

# Who / Background
Donal has been working in IT, networks, and security for about 15 years and after spending time in multinational vendors, telecommunications companies, and hypergrowth startups, he then went on to start a few small businesses fitting out conferences and large coworking spaces with wireless first IT services. During this time he identified the need for better troubleshooting tools for users, vendors, and service providers. After a few detours in to building his own remote HR technical testing tool, and some security deception technology, he returned to the seemingly simple but incredibly complex challenge of providing troubleshooting tools for the burgeoning remote workforce. 

The insight from providing wireless for events and coworking spaces meant that users are not from one distinct organization or company. They are a hodge podge of different entities from freelancers and contractors  to startups and teams from larger organizations who see their digital connections and tools as critical infrastructure. Not all home offices or coworking spaces manage to provide the optimal networks or digital user experiences, and oftentimes these crucial footprints are either unmanaged or the expertise available is unable to diagnose and troubleshoot issues, whether in the moment, historically, and especially with non-tech users.

This is how PanSift was born. It also turns out that remote working for contact centres, sales, or customer success means a lot of realtime communication that necessitates superior connectivity in any location to ensure voice and video quality.

# What It Does
PanSift installs as a lightweight agent on a Mac laptop (Windows/Linux to come) and watches the wireless airspace and connectivity while continually performing a suite of tests to the local network and beyond. This data is then frequently uploaded to the PanSift cloud and any designated entity can then rapidly troubleshoot issues from anywhere. PanSift even makes suggestions for better configuration like Wi-Fi channels and you can customize test endpoints like webpages, DNS records, and traceroutes.

Even if there is a total outage from the ISP, local network, or Wi-Fi edge, PanSift uploads once reconnected or when a user switches to mobile data. This means that a remote technical support team can see exactly what happened, when, and dig in to historical configuration and monitoring, no matter where or when the user is experiencing issues.

# What It Can Do In The Future
With a growing support for different Operating Systems and test tools, PanSift will become the single easiest troubleshooting tool to use, especially for remote work.

Once aggregate data sets are available, anonymized, and normalized, there's a lot that PanSift can then answer on a wider scale. There are also lots of AI (Artificial Intelligence) opportunties for clustering, pattern matching, troubleshooting, and prediction with (WFA) Work From Anywhere data.
