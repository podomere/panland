## Understanding the Function of Internet Addressing

When connecting to the Internet, it's common to have a Public IPv4 address, such as ```50.160.31.247```, or an IPv6 address, like ```2000:de35:ef11:d589:9f92:3f9:4bba:3800```. This information can be verified using a website like [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying these addresses or MAC addresses such as ```76:1b:60:54:d6:3b``` to those who aren't technically inclined tends to be error-prone and complex. Moreover, this method lacks the ability to provide historical data, especially when past issues have occurred.
## How to Reach Websites on the Internet

In order to access a website, like https://dooley.info, you first need to connect to a DNS server to convert the combination of the host portion (dooley) and the Top Level Domain (info) of the URL into an IP address, for example ```14.88.235.131```. When making web requests, your computer and browser automatically send their type, such as <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; AOL 9.7; AOLBuild 4343.19; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; FunWebProducts)```
## The Significance of Default Gateways

A default gateway is usually an address that is automatically assigned through DHCP. The default gateway, such as ```192.168.75.176``` (usually ending in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size), is where your computer sends all its traffic to be routed further. For ```IPv6```, you can find more detailed information on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). Additionally, it is possible to check on Mac or Linux using:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.168.75.176    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:d2b8:b249:a9dd:dee0%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {145.93.203.242, 77.254.146.181}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 76:1b:60:54:d6:3b
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr e4:9c:93:81:43:55
}</pre>




## Resolving Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections
When it comes to sending data to your router, you may be utilizing either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of the version of OSX/macOS you're using, whether it's ```10.12.2```, ```11.1.8```, or ```12.1.9```, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts don't provide a set of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes essential, especially for teams that embrace remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
A highly valuable tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI, and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is point-in-time only in relation to wireless, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```. For an interactive experience, you can run ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will give a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` and be cautious of the file sizes, which are around 300MB.
