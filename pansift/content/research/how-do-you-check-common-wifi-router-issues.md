## Understanding Internet Addressing

When you connect to the internet, your device is assigned a unique address, like ```213.18.2.19``` for IPv4 or ```2000:3c9:6b2a:ac09:bf14:8e12:2733:5d0f``` for IPv6. You can verify this information at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). But translating these addresses for non-technical users or even referencing MAC addresses like ```ea:5f:b1:91:8f:c6``` can be error-prone and complex, especially without historical data.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

Accessing a website, such as https://block.org, involves initial communication with a DNS server to convert the website's host (block) and Top Level Domain (org) to an IP address, like ```0.56.44.69```. Additionally, your computer and browser transmit information about themselves with each web request, such as <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2228.0 Safari/537.36```.
## The Significance of Default Gateways

Default gateways are usually assigned automatically through DHCP and typically appear as addresses like ```192.0.0.37```, often ending in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size. All outbound traffic from your computer is directed to the default gateway, which then routes it further. For troubleshooting ```IPv6``` connectivity on Mac or Linux, refer to [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/).
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.37    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:3014:4bc0:638d:5063%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {255.44.109.54, 179.51.172.244}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr ea:5f:b1:91:8f:c6
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr df:68:a3:03:a8:5d
}</pre>




## Resolving Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections
When it comes to sending data to your router, you may be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Solutions for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of the version of OSX/macOS you are using - whether it's 10.15.5, 11.0.2, or 12.0.1, there are several tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes invaluable, especially for teams that are embracing remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
One of the helpful tools on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of the current wireless settings to the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a variety of logs that are related to wireless, although much of it is only point-in-time information similar to wdutil.

To run it in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, you can use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. Alternatively, you can run it interactively with the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will give a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. However, be mindful of file sizes, which are approximately 300MB.
