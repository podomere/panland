## Functioning of Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, individuals often have a Public IPv4 address, such as ```177.104.108.191```, or an IPv6 address like ```2000:68e6:921c:5fa7:48b6:7745:75e9:f9a4```. One can verify their address at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/), however, non-technical users may find it challenging to communicate or identify MAC addresses like ```a4:46:62:93:ee:48```. This can lead to errors and complications. Moreover, it fails to provide historical data, especially in relation to past issues.
## Navigating the Internet
When attempting to access a website, such as https://reilly.io, the initial step involves contacting a DNS server to translate the host portion (reilly) combined with the URL's Top Level Domain (io) into an IP address, for example, ```144.149.212.71```. Moreover, the computer and browser include their type in all web requests, for instance:
```html
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2228.0 Safari/537.36
```
## Significance of Default Gateways
The default gateway is typically an automatically configured address through DHCP. Users receive a default gateway, such as ```192.168.32.93``` (usually ending in .1 or .254 based on scope size), where the computer forwards all traffic for routing. To explore IPv6 further, a detailed guide is available at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), and on Mac or Linux, the configuration can be checked using the command:
```html
ifconfig
```
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.168.32.93    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:6fb6:e77c:112f:5a3c%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {241.23.35.93, 29.157.242.159}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr a4:46:62:93:ee:48
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 90:46:b1:da:34:06
}</pre>




## Resolving Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections
When dealing with the physical and data layer, it is important to consider whether the medium used is wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) when sending data to the router. 
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of the version of OSX/macOS being used, whether it's ```10.11.8```, ```11.3.9```, or ```12.1.5```, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. Unfortunately, the manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes essential, especially for teams that are embracing remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Utilizing Built-in Scripts
One useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of current wireless related settings to the CLI, and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only relevant to wireless at a specific point in time, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz``` for you. If you prefer to run it *interactively* (although there isn't much interaction), you can execute<br>```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will prompt a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` or use Finder with Cmd+Shift+G to specify the path. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
