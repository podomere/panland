## Understanding Internet Addressing

When connecting to the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address such as ```7.255.134.107``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:93ae:d469:f442:cce2:1d2c:dffa:aa03```. This can be verified at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying these addresses to individuals who may not be technologically savvy, or even referring to MAC addresses like ```c7:be:e8:40:61:85```, can be prone to errors and can become complex quickly. Additionally, this method lacks historical data, especially when previous issues arose.
## Navigating the Internet

When attempting to reach a webpage such as https://doyle.name, the first step is to access a DNS server to convert the host portion (doyle) combined with the Top Level Domain (name) of the URL to an IP address, such as ```140.208.90.129```. Each web request sent by your computer and browser includes its type, for example <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; AS; rv:11.0) like Gecko```
## Significance of Default Gateways

A default gateway is typically an automatically configured address through DHCP. This gateway, such as ```192.0.0.11``` (usually ending in .1 or .254 based on scope size), is where your computer directs all of its traffic to be routed onwards. For ```IPv6```, a detailed guide is available at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), and can be checked on Mac or Linux using: <br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.11    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:fb41:1e59:c0f:9f6d%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {126.5.199.173, 5.80.236.82}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr c7:be:e8:40:61:85
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 28:93:2f:0b:de:15
}</pre>




## Fixing Connection Issues in Wired or Wireless Networks
When it comes to transferring data to your router, you may be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of whether you are running ```10.11.4```, ```11.5.1```, or ```12.2.1```, there are various troubleshooting tools available for macOS users. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, especially for teams that embrace remote work and Work from Anywhere (WFA).
#### Helpful Built-in Scripts
One useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of current wireless related settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only relevant to wireless settings, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will generate logs in ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz``` for you. If you prefer to run it *interactively*, you can use<br>```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, although it will give a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` or use Finder with Cmd+Shift+G to point Finder to the path. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
