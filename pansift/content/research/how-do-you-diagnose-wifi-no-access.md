## Functioning of Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address such as ```134.10.99.227``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:92b1:8c84:910:95e0:708a:3f8b:2046```. You can verify your assigned addresses from [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying these addresses to non-technical individuals or even mentioning MAC addresses like ```c9:50:43:ad:67:f4``` can be prone to errors and can become complex. Moreover, this method does not provide historical data, particularly for past issues.
## Navigating the Internet
When attempting to access a website such as https://larson.info, the process begins by connecting to a DNS server to convert the host segment (larson) along with the Top Level Domain (info) of the URL to an IP address like ```137.250.194.146```. Additionally, your computer and browser include its type in all web requests, for example:
```<br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_3) AppleWebKit/537.75.14 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/7.0.3 Safari/7046A194A```<br>
## The Significance of Default Gateways
Typically, your default gateway is an automatically assigned address through DHCP. This default gateway, such as ```10.91.192.127``` (with commonly ending in .1 or .254 based on the scope size), is where your computer directs all its traffic for further routing. For ```IPv6```, we have an in-depth explanation at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). To check on Mac or Linux, use the following command:<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  10.91.192.127    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:ad50:a854:b62f:371c%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {119.125.250.181, 85.15.10.150}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr c9:50:43:ad:67:f4
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 09:25:6a:f7:42:46
}</pre>




## Resolving Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections
When transferring data to your router, you may encounter issues with either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) connection at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting for Apple macOS / OSX Users
Regardless of whether you are using OSX or macOS versions such as ```10.15.1```, ```11.4.5```, or ```12.1.8```, there are various methods for troubleshooting. However, manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes essential, especially for teams that adopt remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA) policies.
#### Using Built-in Scripts for Assistance
One useful tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to produce a wide range of logs, although many of these are only relevant to a specific point in time, similar to wdutil.

To run it in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will display a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. However, be aware that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
