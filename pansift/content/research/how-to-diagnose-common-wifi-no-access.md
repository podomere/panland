## Understanding Internet Address Allocation

When connecting to the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address such as ```193.249.154.245``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:996e:48c2:d7e2:2c63:91dd:89c2:5e92```. The allocation can be verified using [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, communicating these addresses, as well as MAC addresses like ```77:54:fc:f6:f7:29```, is prone to errors and can become complex. Furthermore, it does not provide any historical data, particularly from previous issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

Accessing a web page such as https://simonis-swaniawski.com involves the initial use of a DNS server to convert the URL's host portion (simonis-swaniawski) combined with its Top Level Domain (com) into an IP address like ```223.54.116.146```. When making web requests, your computer and browser also sends its type, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2228.0 Safari/537.36```
## Understanding the Significance of Default Gateways

The default gateway is typically an automatically configured address through DHCP, such as ```192.0.0.104``` (although they generally end in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size). This is the location where your computer sends all its traffic to be forwarded. For ```IPv6```, a detailed analysis of this process can be found in [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). Additionally, it can be checked on Mac or Linux using the command: <br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.104    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:65c7:fe8b:7342:8ace%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {240.208.24.248, 166.120.14.251}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 77:54:fc:f6:f7:29
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 42:fb:84:d5:3b:b1
}</pre>




## Fixing Connectivity Issues for Wired and Wireless Networks
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be utilizing either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of the version of OSX/macOS you are using - whether it's 10.13.3, 11.5.5, or 12.1.8 - there are numerous tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes extremely valuable, particularly for teams that have embraced remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts 
One extremely useful tool on OSX/macOS is the `sudo wdutil info`, which outputs current wireless settings to the CLI and can also generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Furthermore, the `sysdiagnose` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although many are specific to a particular point in time related to wireless, similar to wdutil.

To run it in the background and write logs to `/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz`, you can use the command `sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &`. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use `sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose`, which will give a privacy warning and open Finder in the correct location. Just be mindful of the large file sizes of around 300MB.
