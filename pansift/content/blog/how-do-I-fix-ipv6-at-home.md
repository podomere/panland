title: 'How Do I Fix My IPv6'
---

**TL;DR:** IPv6 and IPv6 DNS often stops working on residential home routers. This can manifest in strange outages when your browser or computer continues to try using IPv6. Spot when this happens and fix it (including IPv6 DNS) quickly by monitoring your IPv6 and continously keep an eye on your connectivity using automation and smarter tools.

# The Diff Between IPv4 and IPv6
Our Internet runs primarily on two versions of the Internet Protocol; IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 is [running out](https://www.ripe.net/analyse/statistics/number-of-remaining-ipv4-addresses-daily) of addresses but IPv6 is still abundant and will be for a very long time. ISP (Internet Service Providers) and mobile ISPs are increasingly giving out IPv6 addresses **only** and then use mechanisms like [CGNAT (Carrier Grade Network Address Translation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT) to ration and share IPv4 pools amongst us. Not all web and Internet assets are available via IPv4 **and** IPv6 though many are available on both.  You ask your computer for assets and web pages in via words and DNS (Domain Name System) tells your computer which IP addresses those assets are served by. DNS servers (caches/resolvers) will answer your computer based upon the type of query they are asked and over whichever IP protocol is active and has DNS servers configured. Most of this happens automagically, from your local router handing out IPv4, IPv6, and DNS settings, to performing the lookups leveraging mechanisms like [Happy Eyeballs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Eyeballs)

## My IPv6
The next question is, does your ISP support IPv6 and are you supposed to be getting IPv6 connectivity?

# IPv6 Test
There are many ways and tools to test your IPv6 settings and connectivity. You can do so manually by looking at your operating system settings, running command line tools, or visiting remote sites to check how you appear on the IPv4 and IPv6 Internets. From the outside in, you should be represented by a public IPv4 and/or IPv6 address. You can manually check this by visiting [IPv6-Test](https://ipv6-test.com/) however this only shows you a point in time (accessed via HTTPs) and not whether you have any intermittent or historical issues. 

You really need to be testing constantly, which includes making DNS requests and sending IPv6 probes to both your default gateway and out on to the Internet to be 100% sure you are connected end-to-end. Pinging your default gateway via [ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol) is one thing, but checking you can reach and query IPv6 DNS servers and other assets on the IPv6 Internet is another.

## IPv6 DNS Not Working
Let's differentiate between IPv6 DNS requests for IPv6 _records_ and requests that _use IPv6_ i.e. requests that are sent over the IPv6 protocol. 

Without going too deep in to the DNS, you can ask a DNS server for IPv4 or IPv6 records. IPv4 address records are called "A" records and IPv6 address records are called "AAAA" records. You can ask for either type of Resource Records (RRs) from either type of server ðŸ˜Ž.

It's up to whomever owns the assets you've requested as to whether they are a) accessible across the IPv4 or IPv6 Internet **and** b) whether they have the correct types of DNS RRs to let us know how to get there!

### IPv6 DNS Not Resolving

If your IPv6 DNS is not working, how would you know? Well, quite often you don't. If your fundamental IPv6 connectivity goes down you may experience a full outage or just be unable to connect to your configured IPv6 DNS servers and any other IPv6 resources.

## IPv6 Test

First we should check you have IPv6 connectivity and actually have a globally routable IPv6 unicast address (versus a **non-routable** IPv6 link local address).

### IPv6 Link Local and Multicast
FE80::/10 are link-local addresses and FF00::/8 are multicast addresses.

### IPv6 Example

You could quickly jump to looking from the outside -> in by visiting [IPv6-Test](https://ipv6-test.com/) as mentioned earlier or you could simply <code>ping -6 2001:4860:4860::8888</code> yet if either of those fail, you then need to troubleshoot and partition your failure domain to go step by step.

You can look for the presence of IPv6 addresses on a specific interface but let's see if you have a default route in your local IPv6 table (macOS/Linux) and kill two birds with one stone:

<code>netstat -rn -f inet6 | grep -i default</code>

which should return at least one route (below) via a known interface such as "en0" on a Mac or "eth0" depending upon your flavour of Linux. We're also assuming you don't have any fancy tunnels set up too! 

<code>default                                 fe80::5a23:8cff:fe1a:5f21%en0   UGcg            en0
default                                 fe80::%utun0                    UGcIg         utun0
default                                 fe80::%utun1                    UGcIg         utun1
default                                 fe80::%utun2                    UGcIg         utun2</code>

Now you might check if you can send data to that IPv6 default gateway (using IPv6 of course!).

<code>ping6 fe80::5a23:8cff:fe1a:5f21%en0</code> 

**Note:** Notice that the IPv6 default gateway also specifies the interface too (which is different from IPv4). If you get replies, now let's see if we can figure out and talk to your IPv6 configured DNS servers.

Then you would check if you can send ICMP requests to your IPv6 DNS server, and then whether you have IPv6 general connectivity on the wider IPv6 Internet. After that, you would then try to ask your IPv6 configured DNS server for a record.

**Note:** You could just ask for the record immediately from the IPv6 DNS server and then 

#### IPv6 DNS

On macOS and Linux a common tool called <code>dig</code> can be used to make test DNS requests and you can specify which IP protocol and query you would like to make. You can also see which DNS servers are configured via <code>cat /etc/resolv.conf</code> or also <code>scutil --dns</code> on macOS.

Making a test IPv6 query with <code>dig</code> can mean asking an IPv4 server for an IPv6 resource <code>dig @1.1.1.1 AAAA pansift.com</code> but what we really want is to use the IPv6 protocol for transport i.e. ask an IPv6 server, using IPv6, for an IPv6 or IPv4 resource record <code>dig -6 @2606:4700:4700::1111 AAAA pansift.com</code>.

You can try some permutations yourself but you should get a positive response in the answer section much like:

<code>;; ANSWER SECTION:
pansift.com.		300	IN	AAAA	2606:4700:3033::6815:6023
pansift.com.		300	IN	AAAA	2606:4700:3032::ac43:ac41</code>

## Monitor IPv6 Traffic
The above is all essentially toil, undifferentiated heavy lifting, and doesn't help you spot intermittent problems
