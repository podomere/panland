## Understanding Internet Addressing

When connecting to the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address, such as ```173.84.167.179```, or an IPv6 address like ```2000:d571:5073:9ce3:79e6:275:59b8:56b1```. You can check your address using [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). Communicating or referencing these addresses for non-technical individuals is prone to errors and becomes complex. Moreover, it lacks historical data, especially for past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

Accessing a website like https://hyatt-oreilly.io involves sending a request to a DNS server to translate the combination of the host (hyatt-oreilly) and the Top Level Domain (io) to an IP address such as ```199.165.232.197```. Your computer and browser provide information about themselves with every web request, for example: ```Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_3) AppleWebKit/537.75.14 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/7.0.3 Safari/7046A194A```.
## Significance of Default Gateways

The default gateway is typically automatically configured through DHCP and is usually an address like ```192.168.75.104``` (commonly ending in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size). This is the point where your computer directs all its traffic to be routed further. For ```IPv6```, detailed instructions can be found in our blog [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), and you can check on Mac or Linux using the following command:
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.168.75.104    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:3e7b:17e5:1d4c:facc%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {144.48.61.104, 7.34.181.13}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 43:13:89:2a:23:99
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 87:e4:da:55:7f:30
}</pre>




## Fixing Issues with Wired or Wireless Networks

When it comes to sending data to your router, you may be utilizing a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX Users

Regardless of whether you are using OSX/macOS versions such as `10.14.1`, `11.5.3`, or `12.3.1`, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes invaluable, especially for teams that practice remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Utilizing Built-in Scripts to Aid in Troubleshooting

One incredibly useful tool for OSX/macOS is `sudo wdutil info`, which provides a dump to the CLI of current wireless related settings and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Furthermore, the `sysdiagnose` tool can be used to generate a comprehensive range of logs, although much of it is only relevant at a specific point in time in relation to wireless, similar to wdutil.

To run the `sysdiagnose` tool in the background and write logs to `/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz`, you can use the command `sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &`. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use `sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose` and it will open Finder in the correct location or you can navigate to `/var/tmp` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
