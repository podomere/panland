## Understanding IP Addressing

The way internet addressing works is through the use of IP addresses, such as the Public IPv4 address ```179.242.166.116``` and the IPv6 address ```2000:ba25:c872:c032:a2af:aeb2:a58e:508b```. These addresses can be verified on [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, communicating these addresses and MAC addresses like ```60:6f:2c:fc:53:10``` can be challenging and error-prone, especially for those who are not technologically inclined. In addition, this method does not provide any historical data, which is important for troubleshooting past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

When accessing a web page, such as https://kutch.net, a DNS server is initially contacted to translate the URL's host portion combined with the Top Level Domain to an IP address, like ```149.247.130.58```. Every web request sent by your computer and browser includes its type, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; AS; rv:11.0) like Gecko```
## Significance of Default Gateways

The default gateway, typically an automatically configured address via DHCP, such as ```192.0.0.15``` (usually ending in .1 or .254), is where your computer routes all of its traffic. For ```IPv6``` connectivity, detailed instructions can be found at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), but Mac or Linux users can check with: <br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.15    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:64ea:77cb:8450:6986%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {214.162.143.115, 182.73.35.18}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 60:6f:2c:fc:53:10
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 0e:7c:7f:d3:00:e4
}</pre>




## Dealing with Connection Issues
When it comes to transferring data at the physical and data layer, you may encounter problems with either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium connecting to your router.
### Troubleshooting on Apple macOS / OSX Systems
Regardless of the version of OSX or macOS you are using, whether it's ```10.14.8```, ```11.5.7```, or ```12.1.1```, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, especially for teams that are embracing remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Effective Built-in Scripts
An extremely useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump to the command line interface of current wireless settings and can also generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only relevant to wireless issues, similar to wdutil.

To run ```sysdiagnose``` in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will result in a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Keep in mind that the file sizes will be around 300MB.
