# Internet Addressing
On the Internet you may have a Public IPv4 address like **67.181.124.105** or an IPv6 address like **6c89:3af9:e11f:946e:5617:1385:a42:eb08**. You can check this from [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). Yet, for 'non-techies' to try and communicate these addresses, or even call out MAC addresses like **a6:b3:5b:9a:fa:7a**, it's error prone and gets complicated quickly. Additionally, this doesn't give you any historical data (especially back when previous problems occured).

# Accessing the Web
To get to a web page like https://trantow.net you initially access a DNS server to translate the host portion (trantow) of the URL to an IP address like **111.98.245.68**. 

# Default Gateways
Your default gateway is normally an automatically configured address via DHCP. You get a default gateway like **127.171.206.201** (though they normally end in .1 or .254 depending upon the scope size) and this is where your computer sends all its traffic to be routed onwards. For **IPv6** we have a deep dive on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/).

# Wired or Wireless
At the physical and data layer you may be using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium to send this data towards your router.
