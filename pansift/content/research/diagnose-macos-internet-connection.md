## Understanding Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address, such as ```60.168.71.93```, or an IPv6 address like ```2000:e212:feb7:aee6:38fe:effc:141b:12cc```. You can verify these addresses at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, explaining or sharing these addresses, and even mentioning MAC addresses like ```25:ca:7b:24:f2:0e```, can be prone to errors and quickly become complex. Moreover, this method does not provide any historical data, especially in cases of past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

In order to access a website, such as https://buckridge.biz, a DNS server is used to convert the host portion (buckridge) along with the Top Level Domain (biz) of the URL into an IP address, for example ```236.188.107.180```. When making web requests, your computer and browser also send their types, for instance: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; AOL 9.7; AOLBuild 4343.19; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; FunWebProducts)```
## Significance of Default Gateways

Your default gateway is typically an automatically assigned address via DHCP. You will receive a default gateway, such as ```192.168.17.67``` (usually ending in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size), where your computer forwards all its traffic for routing. For ```IPv6```, more in-depth information is available at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/) and can also be checked on Mac or Linux systems using: <br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.168.17.67    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   e7b6:7b:d278:1ba9:f43f:d5f3:de7c:9d52%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {189.229.6.164, 11.79.237.210}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 25:ca:7b:24:f2:0e
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 94:93:65:82:ca:f3
}</pre>




## Resolving Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections
When transferring data to your router, you may encounter issues at the physical and data layer, whether you are using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of the version of OSX/macOS you are using - whether it's ```10.14.5```, ```11.4.4```, or ```12.2.8```, there are several tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes invaluable, particularly for teams that have embraced remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Helpful Built-in Scripts
One useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of the current wireless settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only relevant to wireless settings at a specific point in time, similar to wdutil.

To run it in the background and generate logs in ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, you can use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` and it will provide a privacy warning. If not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. It's important to be aware of the file sizes, which are approximately 300MB.
