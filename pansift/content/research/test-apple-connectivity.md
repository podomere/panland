## Understanding Internet Address Allocation

When using the Internet, you are assigned a unique Public IPv4 address, such as ```98.246.88.232```, or an IPv6 address, like ```2000:45ad:5695:40ae:86f0:11aa:79f5:cc7```. You can verify your address at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). Conveying these addresses, as well as MAC addresses like ```94:4e:4c:be:76:73```, to individuals who are not well-versed in technology can be challenging and error-prone. Moreover, it does not provide any historical data, which is especially valuable for identifying past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

In order to access a website, such as https://von.info, you must first contact a DNS server to convert the host portion (von) along with the Top Level Domain (info) of the URL into an IP address, like ```62.116.233.76```. When making web requests, your computer and browser both send specific information, such as <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win 9x 4.90; SG; rv:1.9.2.4) Gecko/20101104 Netscape/9.1.0285```.
## Understanding the Significance of Default Gateways

Your default gateway is typically automatically configured through DHCP and is assigned an address, such as ```172.30.17.106``` (usually ending in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size). This is where your computer directs all of its traffic to be routed onwards. For ```IPv6```, detailed instructions can be found at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), but on Mac or Linux, you can check using:

<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  172.30.17.106    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:59d5:ef96:3c25:9f00%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {42.54.102.154, 82.87.172.162}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 94:4e:4c:be:76:73
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 56:48:6f:48:e2:37
}</pre>




## Resolve Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be utilizing a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Solutions for Apple macOS / OSX
No matter which version of OSX or macOS you have, whether it's ```10.14.5```, ```11.2.9```, or ```12.2.7```, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts don't provide a comprehensive set of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, particularly for teams that support remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
A valuable tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of the current wireless settings to the CLI, and can be configured to generate specific troubleshooting logs. Moreover, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only related to wireless settings at a specific point in time, similar to wdutil.

To run it in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, you can use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will give a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
