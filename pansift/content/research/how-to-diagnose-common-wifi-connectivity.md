## Understanding Internet Addressing

When you connect to the Internet, you are assigned a unique public IPv4 or IPv6 address. This can be verified on [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, for those who are not familiar with technical aspects, communicating or referencing these addresses, as well as MAC addresses like ```9c:0d:24:08:6c:b7```, can be error-prone and complex. Furthermore, this method lacks historical data, especially when issues have occurred in the past.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

To access a website such as https://toy.org, your computer initially communicates with a DNS server to convert the host name (toy) and the Top Level Domain (org) of the URL into an IP address, such as ```126.10.153.227```. Every web request actually includes the type of your computer and browser, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win 9x 4.90; SG; rv:1.9.2.4) Gecko/20101104 Netscape/9.1.0285```
## The Significance of Default Gateways

Your default gateway is typically automatically configured through DHCP and is assigned an address like ```10.45.105.87``` (although they typically end in .1 or .254, depending on the scope size). This is the destination where your computer sends all its traffic to be routed onwards. For troubleshooting ```IPv6``` connectivity on Mac or Linux, you can refer to our in-depth guide at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/).
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  10.45.105.87    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:8c3e:c448:9eea:8475%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {0.93.227.33, 209.212.218.37}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 9c:0d:24:08:6c:b7
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr a1:b6:a0:1e:01:89
}</pre>




## Resolving Wired vs. Wireless Issues
When transmitting data to your router, you might be utilizing a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) connection at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of the version of OSX/macOS you are using, whether it's ```10.13.9```, ```11.4.7```, or ```12.0.4```, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, especially for teams that are embracing remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Helpful Built-in Scripts
One very useful tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI, and it can also be configured to generate specific troubleshooting logs. In addition, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool offers a more comprehensive option for generating a wide range of logs, although many are only point-in-time logs related to wireless, similar to wdutil.

To run sysdiagnose in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, use ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, but be cautious of the large file sizes of about 300MB.
