title: '11 Tips, Tricks, and Tactics to Get Hired'
---
The Internet (*and* moreso the Web) is full of noise and so are most people's minds. Remember this when you are trying to get a signal through to someone! 

## 1. The Noise Problem

- [x] Hiring teams are busy identifying signal inside and outside of their own organizations.
- [x] There's a hiring funnel and you need to get in it. Don't fail at the first hurdle. You have to capture the attention of **not just** humans **but** machines too. 
- [x] Your signal will go further if it's **stronger** and comes from multiple directions (multipath). At a minimum use the [pincer manoeuvre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pincer_movement) and come at a hiring team from 2 directions (or via a minimum of 2 mediums). Just like in sales, the more priming and conceptual *touches* (3x-8x) you can muster without annoying people, gives you mindshare for engagement and interviews. The more reinforcement regarding your name being heard or read the better.
- [x] Don't ever fool yourself, you are **selling** a part of yourself, your time, your expertise, your energy. You are renting out your labour and/or mind in a **competitive** landscape. 
- [x] It's both **what** you know **and who** you know (or who you can **get to know** or **get to know about you**). Try to get in touch with the right people sooner rather than later (see above 3x-8x) even to just reasarch the role, company culture, and reality of the situation. 
- [x] Whether you are extrovert or introvert, get involved in community groups related to your target domain (either online and/or offline) and deepen your network, connections, contacts, and knowledge. 
- [x] Give away knowledge and energy to your professional community without any expectation of receiving anything back and you'll be a better person for it.
- [x] Don't ever try to game or exploit community - yet the more you give, the more you learn and the more well known you may become. This should be an altruistic byproduct and not an engineered goal. At a minimum, you might have more interesting things to talk about in interviews if you get that far. Call it a form of enlightened self-interest.

## 2. The Underlay Problem

- [x] Your CV is a piece of marketing literature and is self-written (thus you are on shaky ground to begin with unless you are a marketing guru and sales champion who knows their audience intimately).
- [x] Many hiring teams default to distrust CVs as people realize they are broken tokens but the least worst thing we have. This is an open secret. #1 Rule. Don't talk about CV club.
- [x] How can you actually prove your experience in advance of, or during an interview? This is your nut to crack, or theirs to test you. Everything else is a vague and opaque approximation of [Kabuki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabuki) theatre. 
- [x] You are trying to overcome your own bias and that of others, this is a hard problem
- [x] The gendered [Confidence Gap](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/05/the-confidence-gap/359815/) 
- [x] Typos, misspellings, and bad grammar reflect badly (x2) for engineering roles, as it reflects your attention to detail, ability to double check, and level of professional writing and communication in the target language  
- [x] The language you use is important and meaningful. You are conjuring up imagery in the mind of the reader (and/or best fitting a curve or spline in an algorithm).

## 3. The Portfolio Problem (Proof of Experience)

- [x] Show don't tell. Can you actually show something or let them see and interact with something you've built? No? Build something. This is one reason why [FLOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) is good.
- [x] Have you got any video of yourself communicating or presenting? Video is also open to a hiring person's bias but it's better than nothing showing how you present and communinicate. This favours extroverts but perhaps you could give a lightening talk at a local Meetup to start and ask a friend to take a little footage of it.
- [x] Is all your work 'Commercial in Confidence'? Well then, you better try to make or write up something outsied of work that you can show people (see above).

## 4. The Search Problem

- [x] Hiring platforms and webapps are not smart enough, yet. You can effectively [SEO(Search Engine Optimize)](https://pansift.com/blog/how-to-seo-hack-your-cv/) your CV, as most just use simple and limited Boolean Search including tools like [https://recruitin.net/](https://recruitin.net/) and [LinkedIn Search](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/75814/using-boolean-search-on-linkedin).
- [x] Even the new age of machine learning and so called A.I. is built on tainted datasets. They use candidate written CV text (looking for keywords) and many don't take in to account which CVs were successful for which roles (to teach the algorithms further).
- [x] Algorithms also typically get trained on datasets that contain mostly male language patterns thus reinforcing male characteristics and attributes. Tools like [https://textio.com/](https://textio.com/) can help break this cycle by revealing unconscious gender bias early in both Job Descriptions/Advertisements and in your CV.
- [x] Also the Job Description or Position Description that becomes the Job Advertisement is often inaccurate and itself just marketing literature (see above).
- [x] So an A.I. is being trained and matching on, or fitting to an incorrect incomplete Job Description tied to a self-written marketing flyer written by a self-interested party in a competitive landscape.

## 5. Ingestion Process

- [x] Is it going direct via email to a recruiter, sourcer, or the hiring manager... or is it going via an upload on a web based form? 
- [x] Ask yourself how your CV makes it to the eyes of the hiring manager? Map it. Now hack it, ethically.

## 6. CV and Résumé Format

- [x] Short, sharp, and sweet - as a human recruiter will parse your CV "flyer" in less than 20 seconds on first glance and a machine will do it in microseconds to seconds
- [x] This is a sales pitch in a competitive landscape, treat it as such.
- [x] Search for and pay attention to [CV Do's and Don'ts](https://www.evilrecruiter.com/cv_advice/)

## 7. ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) Keywords

- [x] If they already have your CV you want it to resurface as often as possible when keywords are searched for open roles
- [x] Skills surface. Maximize it, ethically. You can invisibly keyword stuff as long as they are valid. The machine will read the text irrespective.

## 8. Recruiters and Sourcers are Human

- [x] Is the recruiter via an agency or in-house? Why does it matter, well, what are they incentivized by and how? Understand this to understand how they are playing the game.
- [x] Is their strategy quality or quantity? Are they a cog in a giant machine or intereseted in building their companies brand with long term relationships? 
- [x] Are they reformatting your CV and sending it on? Are they actually sending through your cover letter? Has the recruiter "screened" you out and why? What can you improve upon? Ask for feedback. Call them. Don't default to email.
- [x] Short term focused recruiters may just be playing the numbers game (or are new at this) but long term focused recruiters could place you 2-3 times over 6-8 years. You might be worth 30-60K to them or more if they can tap **your** network too (see [#1](/1-the-noise-problem)).
- [x] Few actually act as your "agent" so don't deceive yourself that they are in there advocating or selling on your behalf as you might imagine.
- [x] Own your own outcomes. Manage your recruiter and set and agree bi-directional expectations and communication timelines.
- [x] Call your recruiter or coordinator frequently to check-in. If you don't have a voice relationship with a person, make it. Never rely on digital alone. Reinforce your existance.
- [x] Follow up. Follow up every 3-4 days unless you've both set a schedule already. Never stop following up until someone tells you to stop. Use the phone. Acknowledge with email.
- [x] Again. Use the phone. This is your primary tool not your secondary. If you default to email you are both creating distance intentionally.
- [x] Meet your recruiter face to face IRL or via video call at a minimum. Reinforce you exist and are not an avatar at the end of an email.

## 9. Prime the Hiring Manager

- [x] You really want the hiring manager to know your name in advance and be asking for your details or expecting them.
- [x] The hiring manager and hiring team should hear your name from multiple sources in terms of internal employees so shake the tree, nicely. Get in touch with as many people you know there (or could get in touch with) to find out what it's like to work there. 

## 10. Referrals and Referees

- [x] Best way to get your CV seen and increase the time spent by the hiring team reviewing it is via referrals. You have to invest to gain social capital you can then spend. See the point about community (on and offline).
- [x] Non-zero sum games (especially if there's a finders fee/bonus) work well, if someone stands to gain to have you possibly come on board.
- [x] The downside can be hiring in clusters or tribes creating homogeneity. Try and discern this early in your investigations.
- [x] References and referees only matter in the later stages or during character checks.
- [x] Always say "References on request". Everyone know's you've picked affirming people.

## 11. Research is Important Because...

- [x] Find relevant people in the target organisation who you can talk to about the role (even if 2-3 degrees away from you on say LinkedIn) and get in touch with them via your contacts (or go hunting as per [#1](/1-the-noise-problem) ).
- [x] You can get or validate their professional emails via 'lead gen' and email enrichment tools if need be. 
- [x] Arm yourself with as much independent data as you can, maybe you don't actually want this role or to be a part of this organisation (unless you have to)
- [x] During the process of asking questions and connecting with people what often happens is new opportunities present themselves, you just need to let people know you are looking.
  
> If you want this job, you need to work for it, not point and shoot and wait. Get off your ass and through *your* actions (not others) collapse down the multiverse to the one with the greatest probability of you getting in to, and as far down the funnel as you can, ethically!
