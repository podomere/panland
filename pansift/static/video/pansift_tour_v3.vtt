00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.471
Welcome to Pansift. This is your dashboard. No

2
00:00:02.471 --> 00:00:04.834
matter where you are located, or who you are

3
00:00:04.834 --> 00:00:07.574
supporting remotely, you can see real time insights

4
00:00:07.574 --> 00:00:10.153
into their computer's Internet connection, their

5
00:00:10.153 --> 00:00:13.000
local Wi-Fi, and other key metrics that affect voice,

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.095
video, connectivity, and laptop health.

7
00:00:15.364 --> 00:00:17.226
Let's take a look at the most

8
00:00:17.226 --> 00:00:18.767
recent Internet outages.

9
00:00:20.844 --> 00:00:23.760
By clicking on any insight we are immediately taken

10
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.047
to the issue. Let's zoom in a little and

11
00:00:26.047 --> 00:00:28.048
see what's happening on "laptop 3".

12
00:00:28.162 --> 00:00:30.753
We can see it's not specifically the Internet

13
00:00:30.753 --> 00:00:32.711
connection, as there was a problem

14
00:00:32.711 --> 00:00:34.496
reaching the local network too.

15
00:00:34.611 --> 00:00:38.419
Here we can see IPv6 and IPv4 problems.

16
00:00:40.251 --> 00:00:42.670
We also have fast access to the

17
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.933
previous public IP addresses.

18
00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:46.622
We notice that ARP was failing

19
00:00:46.622 --> 00:00:47.965
to complete at times too.

20
00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:50.590
With builtin vendor lookups we can see the

21
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.284
gateway's organizationally unique identifier

22
00:00:53.284 --> 00:00:55.610
to help figure out the type of rowter.

23
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:58.044
We can also see the interfaces used by the

24
00:00:58.044 --> 00:01:00.301
default rout including the hardware type.

25
00:01:00.356 --> 00:01:03.169
And we can also see the local interface

26
00:01:03.169 --> 00:01:05.477
IPs used during this time range.

27
00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.462
At all times, the host details are available to us

28
00:01:08.462 --> 00:01:10.675
on the left hand side, including make,

29
00:01:10.675 --> 00:01:12.074
model, and product type.

30
00:01:13.669 --> 00:01:17.624
We can also see the test hosts used for DNS, trace

31
00:01:17.624 --> 00:01:21.106
rowts, and basic HTTP tests. These hosts are

32
00:01:21.106 --> 00:01:23.479
editable on the paid plan with

33
00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.536
up to 5 arbitrary records.

34
00:01:25.773 --> 00:01:28.861
Now let's take a peak at DNS. We actively query the

35
00:01:28.861 --> 00:01:31.767
configured primary DNS servers for the test host

36
00:01:31.767 --> 00:01:34.794
records. We also do additional random queries that

37
00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:36.852
force full resolution, rather than

38
00:01:36.852 --> 00:01:38.790
relying on cached records alone.

39
00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:41.689
Let's add 30 minutes to either side, to

40
00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.347
get a better picture of response times.

41
00:01:45.012 --> 00:01:47.598
Now let's see where in the world this agent's IP

42
00:01:47.598 --> 00:01:50.292
addresses are coming from during this time period.

43
00:01:50.292 --> 00:01:53.039
Our distributed lighthouses reflect back the public

44
00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:54.601
IP addresses and we give city

45
00:01:54.601 --> 00:01:55.841
level agent resolution.

46
00:01:56.056 --> 00:01:59.895
In the trace and ASN section, we show, not just the

47
00:01:59.895 --> 00:02:03.508
hops, but also generate real time, ASNÂ  lookups,

48
00:02:03.508 --> 00:02:08.551
and also include the A S names. You can spot changes in hop length,

49
00:02:08.551 --> 00:02:10.885
and autonomous system, rapidly.

50
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.051
These paths are available historically for all your

51
00:02:14.051 --> 00:02:16.589
configured test hosts, which includes either

52
00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:18.837
IP or ASN paths for easy cut and paste.

53
00:02:18.953 --> 00:02:23.372
Similarly, we can see status codes, baseline speeds,

54
00:02:23.372 --> 00:02:26.092
and time to first byte for HTTP.

55
00:02:26.177 --> 00:02:28.957
PanSift's agents also allow for the missing link,

56
00:02:28.957 --> 00:02:31.454
that is, for a user to add custom notes with

57
00:02:31.454 --> 00:02:34.348
missing context, during an issue or outage. Even if

58
00:02:34.348 --> 00:02:37.072
they are offline, all notes and measurements are

59
00:02:37.072 --> 00:02:39.172
buffered until the agent syncs again,

60
00:02:39.172 --> 00:02:40.988
via a local network, or hotspot.

61
00:02:41.272 --> 00:02:44.352
Notice that each tab change preserves the current

62
00:02:44.352 --> 00:02:47.432
time window, but if you want to be more specific,

63
00:02:47.432 --> 00:02:50.261
you can specify exact query times quickly and

64
00:02:50.261 --> 00:02:53.404
easily. Additionally, you can even share URL links

65
00:02:53.404 --> 00:02:55.227
with those you invite to view

66
00:02:55.227 --> 00:02:56.925
or administer your account.

67
00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.635
With the explosion in Wi-Fi devices, it's

68
00:02:59.635 --> 00:03:02.323
imperative to understand airtime and channels,

69
00:03:02.323 --> 00:03:05.187
especially in dense environments. Pansift watches

70
00:03:05.187 --> 00:03:07.817
out for weak MCS values and color codes them,

71
00:03:07.817 --> 00:03:10.973
showing you when bad signal quality is causing issues,

72
00:03:10.973 --> 00:03:11.733
or slowdowns.

73
00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:14.638
Pansift is also scanning your local Wi-Fi

74
00:03:14.638 --> 00:03:17.505
environment, intermittently. It records other

75
00:03:17.505 --> 00:03:20.500
networks, including their channels, widths, and

76
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.495
what vendors they are using. This means you can

77
00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:26.681
tell what parts of the airspace are contended, and

78
00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:29.740
what RF space is free. Pansift will even suggest

79
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.735
alternate channels for you to select based upon

80
00:03:32.735 --> 00:03:35.156
what it sees, but taking in to account

81
00:03:35.156 --> 00:03:37.132
your device supported channels.

82
00:03:37.641 --> 00:03:40.027
So, you can rapidly and instantaneously

83
00:03:40.027 --> 00:03:42.840
troubleshoot Wi-Fi, IP, interfaces, status and

84
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.959
more, but without having to try and access a remote

85
00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.017
machine or annoy a non-technical user. You can see

86
00:03:49.017 --> 00:03:51.647
in to the past and right up to the present,

87
00:03:51.647 --> 00:03:52.442
all remotely.

88
00:03:52.747 --> 00:03:55.898
The agent section lets you go direct to any agent

89
00:03:55.898 --> 00:03:58.984
for a deep dive when need be. In the background,

90
00:03:58.984 --> 00:04:01.942
data is stored in buckets, and there's a handy

91
00:04:01.942 --> 00:04:05.093
guide to walk you through onboarding agents. From

92
00:04:05.093 --> 00:04:08.243
the remote user's perspective an agent install is

93
00:04:08.243 --> 00:04:11.072
a simple click with Zero Touch Provisioning.

94
00:04:11.394 --> 00:04:14.177
Congratulations, you've now got the power to save

95
00:04:14.177 --> 00:04:17.016
time, trouble, and toil, all while supporting Work

96
00:04:17.016 --> 00:04:19.571
From Anywhere. Gain the confidence to provide

97
00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:22.240
fearless support! Step through the guide if you

98
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.228
need help, and remember, instrument

99
00:04:24.228 --> 00:04:25.477
your remote user edge!

100
00:04:25.761 --> 00:04:28.771
Now, try out the one click demo yourself, and

101
00:04:28.771 --> 00:04:31.848
install some free agents on a problem machine,

102
00:04:31.848 --> 00:04:33.721
or in an unmanaged location.
