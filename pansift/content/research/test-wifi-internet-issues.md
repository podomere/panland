## Understanding the Operation of Internet Addresses

When using the Internet, it is possible to have a Public IPv4 address such as ```153.8.92.10``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:d74d:27bb:28e:eb6e:a146:af76:d8e1```. This can be verified at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, explaining or using these addresses, as well as calling out MAC addresses like ```dd:bc:61:ca:dd:fb```, can be prone to errors and becomes complex quickly. Moreover, this does not provide any historical data, especially when addressing past issues.
## Navigating through Online Sites
In order to access a website such as https://schumm-emard.co, the initial step is to access a DNS server to convert the host portion (schumm-emard) combined with the Top Level Domain (co) of the URL, into an IP address like ```195.93.222.152```. The computer and browser sends its type with all web requests, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win 9x 4.90; SG; rv:1.9.2.4) Gecko/20101104 Netscape/9.1.0285```
## Significance of Default Gateways
The default gateway is usually an address configured automatically via DHCP, such as ```172.16.159.40``` (although they generally end in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size). This is the point where a computer sends all its traffic to be routed onwards. For ```IPv6```, an in-depth discussion is available at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), with the ability to check on Mac or Linux using the following code:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  172.16.159.40    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:a8b2:a754:8d80:f9f1%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {249.53.80.19, 101.239.34.242}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr dd:bc:61:ca:dd:fb
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 22:5e:8f:7c:31:15
}</pre>




## Solutions for Resolving Wired and Wireless Connectivity Issues
When it comes to transferring data to your router, you may be utilizing either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Steps to Take on Apple macOS / OSX Devices
Regardless of whether you are running OSX/macOS versions such as ```10.15.7```, ```11.4.5```, or ```12.2.9```, there is a wide range of troubleshooting tools available. However, these tools and scripts do not provide a set of correlated values over time, making automated remote troubleshooting an essential solution, particularly for teams that embrace remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
A very handy tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info```, which dumps current wireless related settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a variety of logs, although much of it is only related to wireless at a specific point in time, much like wdutil.

To run it in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. For an *interactive* run (although there is not much interaction), use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will give a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` or use Finder with Cmd+Shift+G to point Finder to the path. However, be aware of the file sizes, which are approximately 300MB.
