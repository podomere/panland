## Understanding Internet Addressing

When you are connected to the Internet, you will receive either a Public IPv4 address such as ```171.46.10.110``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:bbb3:22b8:95fb:f611:c845:2c43:37f6```. These addresses can be verified at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying these addresses or even MAC addresses like ```b2:ca:98:fb:61:33``` to people who are not tech-savvy can be prone to error and can become complicated rapidly. Furthermore, this method does not provide any historical data, particularly for past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

When trying to access a website such as https://auer.info, the first step is to connect to a DNS server to convert the host portion (auer) combined with the Top Level Domain (info) of the URL into an IP address like ```64.85.232.250```. In every web request, your computer and browser send their types, such as <br>```Opera/9.80 (X11; Linux i686; Ubuntu/14.10) Presto/2.12.388 Version/12.16```.
## Significance of Default Gateways

The default gateway is typically an automatically configured address through DHCP. You will receive a default gateway like ```192.168.14.221``` (although they typically end in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size), and this is where your computer forwards all of its traffic to be routed further. For ```IPv6```, you can find detailed information on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), or alternatively, you can check on Mac or Linux using the following command:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.168.14.221    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:f3e9:ad6e:7f08:4572%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {150.243.35.44, 112.47.36.15}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr b2:ca:98:fb:61:33
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr a7:7d:10:76:62:26
}</pre>




## Resolve Wired and Wireless Connectivity Issues

When trying to transfer data to your router, you may encounter issues at the physical and data layer, whether you are using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of whether you are running OSX or macOS version 10.14.3, 11.4.9, or 12.2.5, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. For this reason, automated remote troubleshooting is particularly valuable for teams that have embraced remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
One useful tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI, and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Moreover, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool is even more comprehensive, generating a wide range of logs (though much is only related to wireless at a specific point in time, similar to wdutil).

To run it in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can do so by entering ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` in the terminal. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
