## Understanding Internet Protocol Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned either a Public IPv4 address, such as `205.45.76.54`, or an IPv6 address, like `2000:c546:e000:c658:8826:3937:88fa:9b68`. One way to verify this is by visiting [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, explaining these addresses, or even mentioning MAC addresses like `6b:5f:96:5d:40:61`, to those who are not tech-savvy can be prone to errors and quickly become complex. Moreover, this method does not offer any historical data, especially when dealing with past issues.
## Navigating Through the World Wide Web
In order to access a website, such as https://abbott.biz, the initial step involves reaching out to a DNS server to convert the host portion (abbott) along with the Top Level Domain (biz) of the URL into an IP address, like `117.104.23.30`. Your computer and browser also convey their information with every web request, for example: `<br>``Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT x.y; Win64; x64; rv:10.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0```
## Understanding the Significance of Default Gateways
Usually, your default gateway is an automatically configured address via DHCP. It is assigned as a default gateway, such as `192.168.231.106` (although they usually end in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size), and all traffic from your computer is routed through this location. For more in-depth information on IPv6, visit our blog post on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). To check this on Mac or Linux, you can use:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.168.231.106    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:3567:b2c1:194a:c180%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {190.220.51.66, 241.5.15.94}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 6b:5f:96:5d:40:61
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 1d:87:c0:94:50:5f
}</pre>




## Fixing Connectivity Issues for Wired and Wireless Networks

When transferring data to your router, you may encounter connectivity issues at the physical and data layer, whether you are using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of whether you are using OSX/macOS version 10.15.7, 11.0.9, or 12.1.9, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these tools do not provide a series of correlated values over time, making remote troubleshooting crucial, especially for remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA) teams.
#### Helpful Built-in Scripts
On OSX/macOS, the "sudo wdutil info" command can be used to obtain current wireless settings and generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the "sysdiagnose" tool provides a wide range of logs related to wireless, and can be run in the background using the command "sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &", or interactively by using "sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose". However, users should be aware of the large file sizes generated by this tool, usually around 300MB.
