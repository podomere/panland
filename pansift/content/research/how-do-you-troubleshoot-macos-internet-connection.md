## Functioning of Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address such as ```172.67.135.252``` or an IPv6 address such as ```2000:3bdc:1aa8:e8e2:487a:4407:f281:a732```. Validation of these addresses can be done at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, for those who are not technologically inclined, communicating these addresses, or MAC addresses like ```6e:02:c1:ce:85:25```, can be prone to error and become complicated quickly. Furthermore, it does not provide any historical data, especially for previous issues.
## Navigating the Internet
Accessing a web page like https://harber.io involves initially reaching out to a DNS server to convert the host portion (harber) paired with the Top Level Domain (io) of the URL into an IP address such as ```148.90.66.73```. Every web request from your computer and browser is sent with its specific type, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; AS; rv:11.0) like Gecko```
## Significance of Default Gateways
Usually, your default gateway is an automatically configured address via DHCP. Generally, you receive a default gateway such as ```192.168.101.115``` (though they typically end in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size), and this is where your computer directs all its traffic to be routed onwards. For ```IPv6```, we have an in-depth guide on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), and you can check on Mac or Linux with: <br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.168.101.115    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:af00:9b9:e663:8013%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {132.142.141.79, 26.145.107.72}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 6e:02:c1:ce:85:25
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr ff:0d:89:34:cf:14
}</pre>




## Solve Connection Issues with Wired or Wireless Networks
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be utilizing either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer. 
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of whether you are using OSX or macOS version ```10.13.1```, ```11.4.2```, or ```12.3.7```, there is a variety of tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a set of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes invaluable, especially for teams that embrace remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Using Built-in Scripts for Assistance
A very useful tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless-related settings to the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is point-in-time data in relation to wireless, similar to wdutil.

To run it in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. For an *interactive* run, use ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` which will trigger a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` or use Finder with Cmd+Shift+G to point Finder to the path. Keep in mind that the file sizes can be around 300MB.
