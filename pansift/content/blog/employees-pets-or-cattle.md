Let's talk about culture, hiring, and the candidate experience. HR(Human Resources) and talent teams are the gatekeepers of an organization's culture and thus are also the high level stewards of its true operating system, its people. From the moment a prospective applicant or candidate engages with an organization they are forming both conscious and unconscious opinions about said organization. They also already have a gut reaction or instinct to the brand informed by previous marketing and market sentiment.

More importantly, their perspective has been influenced by peer or personal experiences of said brand. Now that an applicant is interested in working with an organization, everything from here on in shapes their sentiment exponentially. How they are treated sets the tone for their potential future employment (but also if they are unsuccessful, they then become influencers in the market). This is something to be painfully aware of in the age of network recruitment.

Having a structured hiring process that's communicated well such that the applicant or candidate's expectation is set reflects a culture that thinks things through, respects a future workforce, and plans or optimises for its own people. Although everyone is different, a consistent and repeatable process which minimizes bias is something which scales. Once operating from a framework, customization is possible, but a 100% bespoke process each time is sloppy, inefficient, and a bad signal.

For information technology jobs and related engineering careers, the hiring process often includes an online aptitude test (and competency based interview questions) as popular ways to independently verify job skills (a form of 'human' test driven development for teams if you will). Fundamentally CVs are broken and biased, but even more so in today's unregulated and fast moving I.T. industry. Independent verification is crucial in the latest recruitment for engineers.

# Structured Hiring and Applicant Testing

## Technical Job Description
List the minimum viable fundamental skills and ensure that desirable skills are not incorrectly labelled as fundamental. Also highlight the benefits to the candidate in terms of learning opportunities regarding new technologies (aside from traditional benefits packages). 

* Make sure that the benefits to the candidate are listed as you are selling to not just the reader but everyone they speak to about their job application.

## Pre hire Assessment Tests (Measuring Skills)
When a technical recruiter, sourcer or hiring manager is trying to verify claimed skills, it can be helpful to have applicants perform some form of task to demonstrate their technical competency. Unrelated to a psychometric or personality assessment (nor any other behavioural assessment) a job aptitude test can provide at least some data points that either support or deny a CV or résumé.

Advanced technical recruitment teams are increasingly using a *skills* verification test. These tests are sometimes referred to as a skills test, job assessment, take home test, or simulation based screen. They are different from general aptitude tests in that they actually attempt to have an applicant or candidate show distinct capabilities in relation to a more narrow set of skills (as stated in a specific organization's job description).
