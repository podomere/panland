## Understanding Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address such as ```75.99.209.215``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:b4ae:62be:47fb:88f0:d518:7d64:dd42```. A quick way to check this is through [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying these addresses, or even mentioning MAC addresses like ```3a:bb:d9:ff:49:34```, can be error-prone and complex for those not well-versed in technology. Furthermore, this does not provide any historical data, especially regarding past issues.
## Navigating the Internet
Accessing a webpage like https://yost.biz involves an initial connection to a DNS server in order to translate the host portion (yost) and the Top Level Domain (biz) of the URL into an IP address like ```142.32.29.227```. Your computer and browser also include its type in all web requests, such as <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2228.0 Safari/537.36```
## The Significance of Default Gateways
Your default gateway is typically automatically configured through DHCP and comes in the form of an address like ```192.0.0.108``` (although they typically end in .1 or .254, depending on the scope size). This is where your computer sends all its traffic to be routed onwards. For ```IPv6```, you can find a comprehensive guide on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), or check on Mac or Linux with: <br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.108    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:f9a6:9a94:84a1:4de1%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {68.140.232.23, 28.101.153.243}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 3a:bb:d9:ff:49:34
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 8a:64:2c:b1:1c:2f
}</pre>




## Solutions for Wired and Wireless Network Issues
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may encounter issues with both wired and wireless (Wi-Fi) connections at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting on Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of whether you are using OSX, macOS ```10.12.6```, ```11.6.4```, or ```12.0.9```, there are several troubleshooting tools available. While manual actions and scripts can be helpful, they do not provide a comprehensive set of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes essential, especially for teams that support remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
One valuable tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of the current wireless settings to the CLI and can also generate specific logs for troubleshooting. For a more comprehensive set of logs, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs related to wireless issues, albeit many of them are only relevant to a specific point in time, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz``` for you. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will prompt a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Keep in mind that the file sizes will be roughly 300MB.
