    heading   : Operating in a post-breach world.
    content   : >
      It is inevitable that attackers will exploit a vulnerability and get some level of initial access to your infrastructure, systems, or app. They don't sit still and continue to penetrate deeper, move laterally, and attempt to escalate privileges to gather data. They harvest access credentials, API keys, and hostnames related to key accounts or systems.

    title     : 2. What is a Honeytoken ?
    heading   : Inexpensive Lures with Super Signal !
    content   : >
      A honeytoken is a digital lure or tripwire. They can be pseudo-valid usernames/passwords, an API key, a hostname, a PDF file, or other digital asset. They are designed so that once they are accessed or used, they alert your security team (like a canary in a coal mine!). A good example is a set of AWS client/secret keys left in a configuration file that no one but trusted staff should have access to. Once used or accessed, the honeytoken is tripped, and it's time to react to this high-fidelity signal of intrusion.

    heading   : Per Pull Request on Nominated Branches
    content   : >
      <strong>PanSift does not need nor request access to your code.</strong> PanSift automatically honeytokens a specific file per Pull Request. You can leave the tokens there or move them to other parts of your build during deploys, dress them up as you see fit! Use PanSift across <strong>private</strong> repositories/branches that are subsequently deployed anywhere where there is risk of exploit, attack, or compromise such as Internet facing SaaS, cloud infrastructure, or restricted internal systems or apps.
