## Understanding How Internet Addressing Functions

When connected to the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address, such as ```183.166.199.179```, or an IPv6 address, like ```2000:b46e:9702:85b:e8c3:aa82:4964:ef79```. These addresses can be verified at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, for those who are not tech-savvy, communicating or referencing these addresses, along with MAC addresses like ```ff:55:4d:fc:6d:de```, can be prone to error and become complex. Furthermore, it does not offer any historical data.
## Navigating the World Wide Web
When attempting to access a webpage, such as https://osinski.io, the first step involves contacting a DNS server to convert the URL's host portion (osinski) combined with the Top Level Domain (io) to an IP address, such as ```142.7.178.81```. With each web request, your computer and browser provide additional details, like <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_3) AppleWebKit/537.75.14 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/7.0.3 Safari/7046A194A```.
## The Significance of Default Gateways
Normally configured through DHCP, your default gateway is the address your computer forwards all of its traffic to, such as ```192.168.250.86``` (typically ending in .1 or .254 based on the scope size). For ```IPv6```, an in-depth guide is available at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), but you can verify on Mac or Linux using the following command:
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.168.250.86    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:f2ff:a6c6:3bdc:690d%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {48.19.128.212, 9.251.226.192}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr ff:55:4d:fc:6d:de
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr b3:0c:03:51:68:bb
}</pre>




## Resolving Wired and Wireless Connection Issues
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you might encounter issues at the physical and data layer, whether you are using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of whether you are using OSX or macOS version ```10.14.3```, ```11.3.4```, or ```12.2.2```, there are several tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, especially for teams that operate remotely and embrace the Work From Anywhere (WFA) concept.
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
One valuable tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of the current wireless settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Another comprehensive tool is the ```sysdiagnose``` tool, which generates a wide range of logs (although many of the logs are point-in-time related to wireless, similar to wdutil).

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz``` for you. If you prefer to run it *interactively* (although there isn't much interaction), you can use the command<br>```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will provide a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
