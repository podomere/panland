## Understanding the Basics of Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you will be assigned a Public IPv4 or IPv6 address, such as ```24.186.175.146``` or ```2000:e1f4:a578:464:c715:8425:e0aa:a88e```. You can verify this by visiting [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying and recording these addresses, including MAC addresses like ```9f:d2:59:6b:81:93```, can be challenging for non-technical individuals. Moreover, it does not provide any historical data.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

To access a website like https://feil.name, your computer first interacts with a DNS server to convert the URL's host name (feil) and Top Level Domain (name) to an IP address, such as ```89.101.120.95```. Additionally, your computer and browser transmit their type in all web requests, for example:  
```Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; AOL 9.7; AOLBuild 4343.19; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; FunWebProducts)```
## Understanding the Significance of Default Gateways

The default gateway is usually an address automatically configured via DHCP. This gateway, such as ```10.249.200.68``` (typically ending in .1 or .254), is where your computer directs all its traffic for routing purposes. For ```IPv6```, detailed information can be found at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). Additionally, on Mac or Linux, this can be verified using:
```bash
ifconfig```
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  10.249.200.68    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:2fe1:474b:adcb:4bfd%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {81.73.142.151, 88.79.152.48}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 9f:d2:59:6b:81:93
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr e2:c5:fe:04:ad:ba
}</pre>




## Resolving Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections
In order to transmit data to your router, you may be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Techniques for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of which version of OSX/macOS you are currently using, whether it's ```10.12.6```, ```11.3.8```, or ```12.3.5```, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time, which is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes essential, especially for teams that adopt remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Utilizing Built-in Scripts for Assistance
One useful tool for OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI, and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be utilized to generate a wide range of logs, although many are only relevant at a specific point in time in relation to wireless, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```. If you prefer to run it *interactively*, you can execute ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will display a privacy warning. If not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
