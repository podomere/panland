## Understanding Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 or IPv6 address, such as ```208.208.234.37``` or ```2000:55ed:c63:808e:41e8:f4c9:2b63:df8d```. You can verify these addresses at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying these addresses, or even mentioning MAC addresses like ```d5:cf:af:2e:cc:50```, to those unfamiliar with technology can be prone to errors and quickly become complicated. Furthermore, this method does not provide any historical data, especially during previous issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

Accessing a website like https://kiehn-hahn.biz involves the initial step of contacting a DNS server to convert the host portion (kiehn-hahn) combined with the Top Level Domain (biz) of the URL into an IP address, such as ```156.213.219.25```. Your computer and browser include their type in all web requests, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win 9x 4.90; SG; rv:1.9.2.4) Gecko/20101104 Netscape/9.1.0285```
## The Significance of Default Gateways

The default gateway is typically an automatically generated address through DHCP. It could be a default gateway like ```192.168.27.228``` (though typically ending in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size), and this is where your computer directs all its traffic to be routed further. For ```IPv6```, you can find a detailed guide on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), but it can be verified on Mac or Linux using the following command:
```shell
[command line here]
```
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.168.27.228    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:751f:1432:cdc4:d65e%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {190.35.74.182, 242.220.175.190}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr d5:cf:af:2e:cc:50
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr c3:a2:6a:bc:5e:06
}</pre>




## Fixing Connectivity Issues
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may encounter issues at the physical and data layer, whether you're using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) connection.
### Troubleshooting on Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of whether you're running OSX/macOS ```10.11.3```, ```11.2.9```, or ```12.1.9```, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, especially for teams that have embraced remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Utilizing Built-in Scripts
A useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific troubleshooting logs. Furthermore, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although many of them are only relevant to wireless issues, similar to wdutil.

To run ```sysdiagnose``` in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` and it will display a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Be mindful of the file sizes, which are typically around 300MB.
