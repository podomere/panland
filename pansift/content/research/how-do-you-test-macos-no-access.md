# Internet Addressing
On the Internet you might get a Public IPv4 address like ```59.208.79.124``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:c9af:8eb3:ed61:9a2b:2a44:556e:88aa```. You can check this from [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). Yet, for 'non-techies' to try and communicate these addresses, or even call out MAC addresses like ```df:45:18:fd:48:40```, it can be error prone and gets complicated quickly. Additionally, this doesn't give you any historical data (especially back when previous problems occured).

# Accessing the Web
To get to a web page like https://upton-breitenberg.info you initially access a DNS server to translate the host portion (upton-breitenberg) combined with the Top Level Domain (info) of the URL, to an IP address like ```188.36.93.248```. Your computer and browser actually sends its type with all web requests e.g. <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_3) AppleWebKit/537.75.14 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/7.0.3 Safari/7046A194A```

# Default Gateways
Your default gateway is normally an automatically configured address via DHCP. You get a default gateway like ```172.22.7.18``` (though they normally end in .1 or .254 depending upon the scope size) and this is where your computer sends all its traffic to be routed onwards. For ```IPv6``` we have a deep dive on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/) but you can check on Mac or Linux with:

## IPv4 (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  172.22.7.18    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

## IPv6 (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:5735:e7e5:8f4e:afc5%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

# DHCP for IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {57.172.112.119, 123.188.216.140}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr df:45:18:fd:48:40
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr ce:0d:9d:36:8d:40
}</pre>

# Wired or Wireless
At the physical and data layer you may be using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium to send this data towards your router. 

## Apple macOS / OSX
No matter what version of OSX/macOS you are on, ```10.13.2```, ```11.4.3```, or ```12.2.1```, there are a range of tools for troubleshooting. Unfortunately, between these manual actions and scripts, they don't give you a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting comes in to its own, especially for teams that embrace remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).

### Scripts
One very helpful tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info``` which gives a dump to the CLI of current wireless related settings, and this can be configured to also generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, and perhaps more comprehensively the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a whole host of logs (though much is point in time only in relation to wireless just like wdutil).

```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` will run it in the background and it will write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz``` for you. If you want to run it *interactively* (though there is not much interaction) you can run<br>```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` and it will give a privacy warning. When not run in the background it should open Finder in the correct location or you can then navigate to ```/var/tmp``` or use Finder with Cmd+Shift+G to point Finder to the path. Just beware the file sizes of about 300MB more or less.
