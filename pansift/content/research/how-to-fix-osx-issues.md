## Understanding the Concept of Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address, such as ```110.126.96.241```, or an IPv6 address, like ```2000:96ae:128d:3a2d:3ead:48a2:2a9b:1a6f```. You can verify this information at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying these addresses to individuals who are not technically inclined can be prone to errors and can become complex. Moreover, this method does not offer any historical data, especially when dealing with past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web
In order to access a website such as https://schultz-mayer.com, you initially connect to a DNS server to translate the host portion (schultz-mayer) along with the Top Level Domain (com) of the URL into an IP address, such as ```175.17.225.209```. Your computer and browser send its type with all web requests, for example:<br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_3) AppleWebKit/537.75.14 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/7.0.3 Safari/7046A194A```
## Exploring the Significance of Default Gateways
By default, your gateway is automatically configured via DHCP and you are provided with an address, such as ```192.0.0.77``` (although they typically end in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size). This is where your computer sends all its traffic to be routed onwards. For IPv6, a thorough guide can be found at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), and it can be checked on Mac or Linux using the following commands:
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.77    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:5e8a:b997:550a:7d05%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {220.17.213.12, 134.9.214.175}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 6e:09:9b:8c:e6:a0
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr a3:5d:9c:f4:99:03
}</pre>




## Resolving Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections

When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of whether you are running OSX/macOS version ```10.14.9```, ```11.2.3```, or ```12.0.1```, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes invaluable, especially for teams that have adopted remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Utilizing Built-in Scripts for Assistance
One useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can also generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although many of them are only relevant to wireless at a specific point in time, similar to wdutil.

To run ```sysdiagnose``` in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, you can use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will give a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to the path ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. It's important to note that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
