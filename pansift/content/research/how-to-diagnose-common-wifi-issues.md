## Understanding How Internet Addresses Function

When using the Internet, you will have either a Public IPv4 address (like ```46.214.126.203```) or an IPv6 address (like ```2000:658b:ee1b:6e51:7614:4ad2:835b:19ff```). You can verify this at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, for those not well-versed in technology, attempting to communicate these addresses, or even recite MAC addresses (like ```15:39:6c:d6:2e:d1```), can be prone to errors and become complex. Moreover, this method does not provide any historical data, especially with regards to past issues.
## Navigating the Internet
When accessing a website such as https://nicolas.net, you initially connect to a DNS server to convert the combination of the host portion (nicolas) and the Top Level Domain (net) of the URL into an IP address, such as ```207.94.206.237```. When making any web requests, your computer and browser transmit the data type, as seen in the example below:
```Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; AOL 9.7; AOLBuild 4343.19; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; FunWebProducts)```
## Understanding the Significance of Default Gateways
Typically, your default gateway address is configured automatically by DHCP. You will receive a default gateway address (like ```192.168.108.235```, often ending in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size), and this is where your computer directs all its traffic for further routing. For a more in-depth look into ```IPv6``` connectivity issues, refer to our article [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), or perform checks on Mac or Linux using the method shown below:
```<br>```
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.168.108.235    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:38b5:740e:3c53:edb%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {107.90.41.92, 186.18.27.48}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 15:39:6c:d6:2e:d1
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 32:c7:77:cd:10:cb
}</pre>




## Resolving Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections
When it comes to transmitting data at the physical and data layer, you may opt for a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium to connect to your router.
### Solutions for Apple macOS / OSX Users
Regardless of whether you are using OSX/macOS versions such as ```10.11.1```, ```11.3.5```, or ```12.1.5```, there are several troubleshooting tools available. Unfortunately, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, especially for teams that are embracing remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Utilizing Built-in Scripts
A useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of current wireless related settings to the CLI. This can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool offers a more comprehensive approach, generating a wide range of logs related to wireless (though much of it is point-in-time only, similar to wdutil).

To run ```sysdiagnose``` in the background and generate logs in ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, you can use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` which will issue a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. However, be mindful of the file sizes, which are approximately 300MB or slightly more.
