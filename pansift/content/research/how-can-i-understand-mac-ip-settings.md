## Understanding Internet Addressing

When connecting to the internet, you are assigned a unique public IP address such as ```17.238.117.18``` for IPv4 or ```2000:4fc0:1ac9:41b8:746f:9b0b:9d12:5df7``` for IPv6. Checking your IP address is possible at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying these addresses to non-technical individuals, or even referencing MAC addresses like ```65:02:3d:1c:7e:e3``` can be prone to errors and become complex. Unfortunately, this method does not provide historical data, especially when resolving past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

Accessing a website such as https://kuhic.io involves an initial communication with a DNS server to translate the host (kuhic) and the Top-Level Domain (io) of the URL into an IP address like ```46.223.218.175```. Furthermore, every web request from your computer and browser includes its type, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; AOL 9.7; AOLBuild 4343.19; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; FunWebProducts)```
## The Significance of Default Gateways

The default gateway is typically an address assigned automatically via DHCP, such as ```192.168.18.146``` (usually ending in .1 or .254, depending on the scope size). This is the point where your computer forwards all of its traffic for routing. For ```IPv6```, detailed instructions can be found at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). On Mac or Linux, you can verify this using the following command.
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.168.18.146    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:9c91:eb1d:9531:4438%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {22.28.14.212, 95.108.54.151}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 65:02:3d:1c:7e:e3
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 22:bc:6a:a2:94:72
}</pre>




## Diagnosing and Resolving Wired and Wireless Connectivity Issues

When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you might be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Steps for Troubleshooting on Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of whether you are on OSX or macOS, whether it's version ```10.14.2```, ```11.1.8```, or ```12.1.2```, there are various tools available for diagnosing connectivity issues. However, the manual actions and scripts may not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, especially for teams that are working remotely or following a Work From Anywhere (WFA) approach.
#### Useful Built-in Tools for Troubleshooting
One useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of the current wireless settings to the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although many of them are only relevant to wireless at a specific point in time, similar to wdutil.

To run sysdiagnose in the background and save logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, you can use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. Alternatively, you can run it interactively with the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will provide a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. However, be cautious of file sizes, which can be around 300MB or more.
