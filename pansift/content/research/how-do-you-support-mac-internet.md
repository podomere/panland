## The Functioning of Internet Addressing

When accessing the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address, such as ```217.131.16.191```, or an IPv6 address, like ```2000:14b0:43a9:afa9:a31f:7062:be1d:4b1e```. Verification can be done by visiting [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). Communicating these addresses or MAC addresses like ```78:96:12:1a:31:22``` can be error-prone and complex for those unfamiliar with technology. Additionally, it lacks historical data, particularly related to past issues.
## How to Reach Websites

When attempting to access a website, such as https://jakubowski.name, the process involves initially accessing a DNS server to convert the host component (jakubowski) and the Top Level Domain (name) of the URL into an IP address, like ```17.118.117.130```. For every web request, your computer and browser sends its type, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; AS; rv:11.0) like Gecko```
## The Significance of Default Gateways

The default gateway, usually configured automatically via DHCP, assigns an address like ```192.168.108.123``` (typically ending in .1 or .254 based on the scope size). This is where all of your computer's traffic is routed. For ```IPv6```, detailed guidance is available at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), and you can verify on Mac or Linux using:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.168.108.123    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:51b5:23cb:f02c:b97b%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {246.65.150.153, 103.116.199.225}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 78:96:12:1a:31:22
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 0e:d7:45:cd:29:ed
}</pre>




## Fixing Connectivity Issues for Wired and Wireless Networks

When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
No matter which version of OSX/macOS you are currently running - whether it's ```10.13.2```, ```11.0.2```, or ```12.2.6``` - there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, particularly for teams that are embracing remote work and the Work From Anywhere (WFA) trend.
#### Helpful Built-in Scripts
One particularly useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Furthermore, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs (although many are only point-in-time in relation to wireless, similar to wdutil).

To run ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, or to run it interactively, you can use ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```. Just be mindful of the large file sizes, which are approximately 300MB.
