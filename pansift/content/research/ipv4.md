# Internet Addressing
On the Internet you may have a Public IPv4 address like **213.121.100.144** or an IPv6 address like **cdba:1ee2:cd32:d5db:7a19:a66c:b03:f261**. You can check this from [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). Yet, for 'non-techies' to try and communicate these addresses, or even call out MAC addresses like **8d:74:88:49:ea:8e**, it's error prone and gets complicated quickly. Additionally, this doesn't give you any historical data (especially back when previous problems occured).

# Accessing the Web
To get to a web page like https://gulgowski.org you initially access a DNS server to translate the host portion (gulgowski) combined with the Top Level Domain org of the URL, to an IP address like **76.198.170.17**. 

# Default Gateways
Your default gateway is normally an automatically configured address via DHCP. You get a default gateway like **10.59.199.169** (though they normally end in .1 or .254 depending upon the scope size) and this is where your computer sends all its traffic to be routed onwards. For **IPv6** we have a deep dive on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/).

# Wired or Wireless
At the physical and data layer you may be using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium to send this data towards your router.
