## Understanding Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you will be assigned a Public IPv4 or IPv6 address, such as ```115.232.25.99``` or ```2000:f46d:1dc7:14f0:a708:ac86:88df:8f80```. These addresses can be verified at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, attempting to relay these addresses, or even MAC addresses like ```77:2e:90:91:a9:39```, to those who are not technically inclined can be prone to errors and becomes complex quickly. Furthermore, this method does not provide any historical data, especially from previous issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

In order to access a website like https://abbott-kessler.name, your computer initially connects to a DNS server to convert the host part (abbott-kessler) along with the Top Level Domain (name) of the URL to an IP address like ```58.67.174.232```. Your computer and browser includes its type in all web requests, for example: <br>```Opera/9.80 (X11; Linux i686; Ubuntu/14.10) Presto/2.12.388 Version/12.16```
## The Significance of Default Gateways

The default gateway is typically an automatically assigned address via DHCP. You will receive a default gateway like ```192.0.0.144``` (although they generally end in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size), which is where your computer directs all of its traffic to be routed further. For more details on ```IPv6```, you can refer to our in-depth guide at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), or you can verify it on Mac or Linux with: <br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.144    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:7f5c:b7f2:c0be:3825%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {122.63.62.42, 0.85.63.22}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 77:2e:90:91:a9:39
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 7c:51:9d:90:39:9f
}</pre>




## Resolving Issues with Wired and Wireless Connection
When transmitting data to your router, you may be utilizing a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of which version of OSX/macOS you are using, whether it's ```10.13.4```, ```11.4.7```, or ```12.3.1```, there is a variety of troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes essential, especially for teams that are embracing remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
One valuable tool in OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can also generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only relevant to wireless at a specific point in time, similar to wdutil.

To run it in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, use ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` (although there is not much interaction) and beware of the large file sizes of about 300MB.
