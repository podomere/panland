## The Function of Internet Addressing 

When accessing the Internet, you may receive a Public IPv4 address such as ```231.30.177.144``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:4548:9595:e073:a3b6:2d1f:a697:bc2c```. This information can be verified on [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, for individuals who are not technically savvy, attempting to convey or recognize these addresses, or even reference MAC addresses like ```19:ff:f9:42:c7:61```, can be prone to errors and become complicated. Furthermore, this does not provide any historical data, especially regarding past issues.
## Navigating the Internet

In order to access a webpage such as https://larson.co, you begin by accessing a DNS server to convert the host portion (larson) in combination with the Top Level Domain (co) of the URL into an IP address, for example, ```61.163.46.186```. Your computer and browser send their types with all web requests, for example, <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; AS; rv:11.0) like Gecko```
## The Significance of Default Gateways

Your default gateway is typically an automatically configured address through DHCP. A default gateway, such as ```192.0.0.177``` (although they usually end in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size), is where your computer sends all its traffic to be routed onwards. For ```IPv6```, detailed instructions can be found on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/) but it can also be checked on Mac or Linux with:

<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.177    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:745f:86f:3c55:c365%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {231.191.142.122, 62.27.88.85}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 19:ff:f9:42:c7:61
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr b3:5e:48:d3:d0:9a
}</pre>




## Diagnosing and Resolving Wired and Wireless Connectivity Issues

When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Tips for Troubleshooting on Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of whether you are using OSX or macOS ```10.12.1```, ```11.1.3```, or ```12.3.2```, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, especially for teams that adopt remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA) practices.
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
An important tool for troubleshooting on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI. This tool can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. In addition, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs related to wireless issues, although much of it is only point-in-time data, similar to wdutil.

To run ```sysdiagnose``` in the background and generate logs in ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, you can use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` and it will give a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
