## Understanding Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you're assigned a unique Public IPv4 or IPv6 address such as ```99.199.65.227``` or ```2000:3a9a:f74e:76af:b7eb:1b39:8352:e927```. You can verify this information at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, explaining or referencing these addresses, as well as MAC addresses like ```ed:99:ba:11:4c:0d```, can be prone to errors and quickly become complex, especially for those who aren't tech-savvy. Additionally, it doesn't provide any historical data, particularly concerning past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

When accessing a website like https://hoppe.net, your computer first communicates with a DNS server to convert the URL's host portion (hoppe) and the Top Level Domain (net) into an IP address, such as ```131.246.179.226```. Notably, your computer and web browser include its type in every web request, such as <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT x.y; Win64; x64; rv:10.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0```
## The Significance of Default Gateways

By default, your computer's gateway is obtained through DHCP and is typically an automatically configured address, like ```172.17.113.84``` (often ending in .1 or .254, depending on the scope size). This is the point to which your computer sends all of its traffic to be routed further. For ```IPv6```, you can find more details in our comprehensive guide on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/) and also perform a check on Mac or Linux with: <br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  172.17.113.84    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:3cbb:4e9d:2a5e:417c%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {177.172.27.152, 123.242.209.244}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr ed:99:ba:11:4c:0d
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr c7:fe:96:bc:9b:ce
}</pre>




## Resolve Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections
Whether you are using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer to send data to your router, troubleshooting may be required.
### Tips for Apple macOS / OSX Users
Regardless of the version of OSX/macOS you are using, such as ```10.12.5```, ```11.1.9```, or ```12.2.8```, there are various tools available for resolving issues. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, especially for teams that embrace remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
A useful tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump to the CLI of current wireless-related settings and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is related to wireless only like wdutil.

You can run it in the background using the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```, which will write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```. Alternatively, you can run it *interactively* with the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, although there is not much interaction. Just be cautious of the large file sizes, around 300MB.
