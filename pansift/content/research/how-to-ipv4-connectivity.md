# Internet Addressing
On the Internet you might get a Public IPv4 address like **204.20.34.195** or an IPv6 address like **38f5:ac9e:6da6:d70a:bb5f:2f0d:6575:968**. You can check this from [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). Yet, for 'non-techies' to try and communicate these addresses, or even call out MAC addresses like **42:9b:62:c0:26:4d**, it's error prone and gets complicated quickly. Additionally, this doesn't give you any historical data (especially back when previous problems occured).

# Accessing the Web
To get to a web page like https://steuber.com you initially access a DNS server to translate the host portion (steuber) combined with the Top Level Domain com of the URL, to an IP address like **96.101.61.43**. 

# Default Gateways
Your default gateway is normally an automatically configured address via DHCP. You get a default gateway like **100.103.129.154** (though they normally end in .1 or .254 depending upon the scope size) and this is where your computer sends all its traffic to be routed onwards. For **IPv6** we have a deep dive on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/).

# Wired or Wireless
At the physical and data layer you may be using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium to send this data towards your router.
