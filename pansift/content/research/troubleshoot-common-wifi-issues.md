## Understanding Internet Protocol Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned a public IP address, such as ```65.152.173.210``` for IPv4 or ```2000:23a3:bf82:108f:a3cb:4a28:d95b:3fe0``` for IPv6. You can verify this information by visiting [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, expressing these addresses, or even MAC addresses like ```02:62:3d:5c:65:b5```, can be challenging for those who are not tech-savvy. In addition, this does not provide any historical data, especially when dealing with past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

Accessing a website, such as https://pacocha-paucek.net, involves querying a DNS server to translate the URL's host portion (pacocha-paucek) and Top Level Domain (net) into an IP address, like ```62.236.142.31```. When making web requests, your computer and browser include information about their type, for example: <br>```Opera/9.80 (X11; Linux i686; Ubuntu/14.10) Presto/2.12.388 Version/12.16```
## The Significance of Default Gateways

The default gateway is typically assigned automatically via DHCP and is represented by an address like ```172.23.141.71``` (often ending in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size). This is where your computer directs all its traffic to be routed elsewhere. For ```IPv6```, detailed instructions can be found at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), and you can check on Mac or Linux by using the following command:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  172.23.141.71    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:b26c:5ec3:b3b6:5403%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {101.8.170.130, 223.206.0.144}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 02:62:3d:5c:65:b5
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 48:fd:28:41:35:1a
}</pre>




## Resolve Issues with Wired or Wireless Connections

When sending data to your router, you may be utilizing either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Steps for Apple macOS / OSX Users
Regardless of the version of OSX/macOS you are using - whether it's ```10.13.2```, ```11.2.2```, or ```12.2.3``` - there are various tools available for resolving connectivity issues. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes particularly useful, especially for teams that have embraced remote work and the concept of Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
A valuable tool for OSX/macOS users is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of the current wireless settings to the command line interface and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting purposes. Moreover, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be utilized to generate a comprehensive set of logs, although most of it relates to wireless issues just like wdutil.

To run ```sysdiagnose``` in the background and generate logs in ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. Alternatively, if you prefer to run it interactively, you can use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` which will display a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Keep in mind that the file sizes will be approximately 300MB.
