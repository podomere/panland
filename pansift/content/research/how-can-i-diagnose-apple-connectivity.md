## Understanding IP Addressing

When using the Internet, individuals may be provided with a Public IPv4 address such as ```246.12.193.255``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:afea:c082:b126:2097:2b74:e1c5:ffde```. These addresses can be verified by visiting [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying these addresses to those who are not tech-savvy, or even referencing MAC addresses like ```82:5f:aa:b8:c4:67```, can quickly become prone to errors and complex. Moreover, there is no historical data available, particularly for past issues.
## Navigating the Internet

When attempting to reach a webpage, such as https://ruecker.biz, the first step involves accessing a DNS server to convert the URL's host portion (ruecker) combined with its Top Level Domain (biz) into an IP address, such as ```154.227.43.55```. Additionally, computers and browsers send their type with every web request, for example:
```html
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_3) AppleWebKit/537.75.14 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/7.0.3 Safari/7046A194A
```
## The Significance of Default Gateways

By default, a gateway is usually automatically configured through DHCP. This gateway, such as ```10.196.236.92``` (typically ending in .1 or .254 based on the scope size), is where a computer directs all of its traffic to be routed. For ```IPv6```, detailed instructions can be found at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), or it can be verified on Mac or Linux using:
```html

### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  10.196.236.92    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:a03b:5544:88c0:58c7%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {94.33.216.193, 125.17.148.24}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 82:5f:aa:b8:c4:67
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 36:88:64:45:a7:a6
}</pre>




## Resolving Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Strategies for Addressing Problems on Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of whether you are running OSX/macOS version ```10.11.1```, ```11.5.7```, or ```12.2.4```, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a set of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes invaluable, particularly for teams that have adopted remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA) practices.
#### Utilizing Pre-Installed Scripts for Assistance
A highly useful tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI. This tool can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting purposes. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool offers a more comprehensive range of logs, although much of it is relevant to wireless issues only, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will generate logs in ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz``` for you. If you prefer to run it *interactively*, you can execute ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will trigger a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Keep in mind that the file sizes are around 300MB, give or take.
