## The Functioning of Internet Addressing

When connecting to the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address such as ```101.230.20.116``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:195d:b575:d22:c2ae:b0d5:7dbe:b318```. You can verify this information by visiting [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, relaying these addresses or MAC addresses like ```af:57:42:3e:50:5f``` to individuals without technical knowledge can result in errors and complexity. Furthermore, the lack of historical data from past issues doesn't help.
## Navigating the Internet
To access a website like https://hettinger.co, your first point of contact is a DNS server, which translates the host portion (hettinger) along with the Top Level Domain (co) of the URL into an IP address, such as ```193.77.183.198```. Every time you make a web request, your computer and browser include information about their type, for example <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; AOL 9.7; AOLBuild 4343.19; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; FunWebProducts)```
## The Significance of Default Gateways
The default gateway is typically an address that is automatically configured through DHCP. In most cases, you will receive a default gateway like ```192.0.0.154``` (usually ending in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size), and this is the destination where your computer sends all its outbound traffic. For details on ```IPv6```, you can refer to our comprehensive guide on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/) or perform a check on Mac or Linux by using:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.154    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:e1a3:9452:ca32:88b9%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {189.207.59.101, 60.167.149.250}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr af:57:42:3e:50:5f
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 98:a8:bf:71:48:2f
}</pre>




## Troubleshooting Methods for Wired and Wireless Connections
When it comes to sending data to your router, you may be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Tips for Apple macOS / OSX Users
Whether you're running macOS or OSX version ```10.15.8```, ```11.3.2```, or ```12.0.9```, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes essential, especially for teams that are embracing remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
A very useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump to the CLI of current wireless related settings and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting purposes. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is point-in-time only in relation to wireless, similar to wdutil.

To run sysdiagnose in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, you can use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will give a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Just be aware of the file sizes, which are about 300MB more or less.
