## Understanding Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 or IPv6 address. For non-technical individuals, communicating these addresses can be challenging and error-prone. Moreover, it lacks historical data.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

Accessing a website involves a process of translating the URL to an IP address through a DNS server. Your computer and browser also send its specifications with every web request.
## The Role of Default Gateways

The default gateway, typically obtained through DHCP, is where your computer sends all its traffic to be routed onwards. For IPv6, there are specific instructions for checking on Mac or Linux.
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  172.16.52.187    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:50f8:b592:5b8:cb66%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {0.143.177.210, 212.216.20.74}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr f1:7c:f2:ce:02:64
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr eb:36:2b:7c:df:c9
}</pre>




## Resolve Issues with Wired and Wireless Networks
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you might be using either a wired or a wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layers.
### Tips for Apple macOS / OSX Users
Regardless of the version of macOS or OSX you have, whether it's ```10.11.9```, ```11.2.9```, or ```12.0.7```, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes extremely useful, especially for teams that are fully embracing remote work and the Work From Anywhere (WFA) concept.
#### Utilize These Pre-installed Scripts
One valuable tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can be set up to generate specific logs for troubleshooting purposes. Moreover, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool is even more comprehensive, generating a wide range of logs (although many are only relevant to wireless settings, just like wdutil).

To run it in the background and have it write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` but be aware that it will give a privacy warning. Running it in the background should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Be cautious of the file sizes, which are around 300MB.
