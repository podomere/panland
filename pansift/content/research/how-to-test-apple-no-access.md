## Understanding Internet Addressing
When using the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address, such as ```67.88.28.163```, or an IPv6 address, like ```2000:401c:d69d:b6b4:3606:a519:dddf:93f8```. You can verify this information by visiting [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, relaying these addresses to individuals who are not tech-savvy, or even identifying MAC addresses like ```c4:a7:b0:8c:f2:74```, can be prone to errors and quickly become complex. Furthermore, it does not provide any historical data, especially when past issues arise.
## Navigating the World Wide Web
In order to reach a webpage, such as https://heathcote.com, you first connect to a DNS server to convert the host portion (heathcote) combined with the Top Level Domain (com) of the URL to an IP address, like ```86.158.159.190```. Your computer and browser also transmit their type with every web request, such as <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; AOL 9.7; AOLBuild 4343.19; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; FunWebProducts)```.
## The Significance of Default Gateways
Your default gateway is typically an automatically configured address via DHCP. You are assigned a default gateway, such as ```172.19.83.204``` (although they generally end in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size), and this is the destination where your computer forwards all its traffic to be routed. For ```IPv6```, we elaborate on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), but you can verify this on Mac or Linux with: <br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  172.19.83.204    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:3bdf:d66c:b518:c8b2%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {230.192.156.176, 149.238.60.103}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr c4:a7:b0:8c:f2:74
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr f9:ff:e6:9c:d6:2d
}</pre>




## Solve Connectivity Issues for Wired and Wireless Networks
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be utilizing either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX Devices
Regardless of whether you are using OSX/macOS versions like ```10.13.3```, ```11.6.8```, or ```12.2.9```, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual procedures and scripts do not provide a set of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, especially for teams that embrace remote work and the concept of working from anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
One valuable tool for OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can also generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs related to wireless issues, although many of these are only relevant to a specific point in time, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz``` for you. If you prefer to run it *interactively*, you can use<br>```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` and it will display a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
