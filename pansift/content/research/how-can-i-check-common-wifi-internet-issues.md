## The Functioning of Internet Addressing 

When using the Internet, you can obtain a Public IPv4 address such as ```181.244.26.108``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:4d33:c5b5:4b20:5a15:6082:f0d6:c2a8```. This information can be verified at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, explaining these addresses to individuals who are not tech-savvy, or even providing MAC addresses like ```d6:83:a0:3d:25:06```, can result in errors and become complex quickly. Moreover, this approach does not provide any historical data, particularly regarding previous issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

In order to visit a website such as https://rohan.info, the initial step involves accessing a DNS server to convert the host portion (rohan) combined with the Top Level Domain (info) of the URL into an IP address like ```201.125.53.231```. Your computer and browser actually send their type with all web requests, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_3) AppleWebKit/537.75.14 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/7.0.3 Safari/7046A194A```
## Understanding the Significance of Default Gateways

The default gateway is typically an address that is automatically configured via DHCP. You receive a default gateway such as ```192.0.0.109``` (although they usually end in .1 or .254 depending upon the scope size) and this is where your computer directs all its traffic to be routed onwards. For manual checking on Mac or Linux, one can refer to the detailed information provided in [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/) for ```IPv6``` connectivity.
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.109    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:7c2d:5b3f:67a3:4ed7%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {189.68.19.129, 201.195.76.200}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr d6:83:a0:3d:25:06
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 5e:23:76:e8:30:18
}</pre>




## Ways to Resolve Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections
When it comes to sending data to your router, the physical and data layer may involve using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium.
### Steps to Take on Apple macOS / OSX
No matter the version of OSX/macOS you are utilizing, whether it's ```10.15.4```, ```11.2.1```, or ```12.2.9```, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes essential, especially for teams that are embracing remote work and the concept of Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
A handy tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump to the CLI of current wireless related settings and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. In addition, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only relevant at a specific point in time, similar to the wdutil tool.

To run ```sysdiagnose``` in the background and have it write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` and it will give a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Keep in mind that the file sizes are around 300MB give or take.
