title: '11 Tips, Tricks, and Tactics to Get Hired'
---
The Internet (*and* more so the Web) is full of noise and increasingly, so are many people's minds. Remember this when you are trying to get a signal through to someone during their day! 

## 1. The Noise Problem

- [x] Hiring teams are busy identifying signals from both inside and outside of their own organizations.
- [x] There's a hiring funnel and you need to get in to it. Don't fail at the first hurdle. You have to capture the attention of **not just** humans **but** also machines too. 
- [x] Your signal will go further if it's **stronger** and comes from multiple directions (multipath). At a minimum use the [pincer manoeuvre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pincer_movement) and come at a hiring team from **2** directions (or via a minimum of **2** mediums). Just like in sales, the more priming and conceptual *touches* (**3x-8x**) that you can muster without annoying people, the more mind share you get for subsequent engagement or interviews. Reinforcement of your name being heard or read frequently (in a good context of course) is desirable.
- [x] Don't ever fool yourself, you are **selling** a part of yourself; your time, your expertise, your energy, and your life. You are renting out your labour and/or mind amidst a **competitive** landscape. Your CV is your personal advertisement and it must leverage more than just psychology to be seen let alone heard.
- [x] Whether you are extrovert or introvert, get involved in community groups related to your target domain (either online and/or offline) and deepen your network, connections, contacts, and knowledge. 
- [x] Give away knowledge and energy to your professional community without any expectation of receiving anything back and you'll be a better person for it. If there's no community there or around you, build it yourself.
- [x] Don't ever try to game or exploit community - yet the more you give, the more you learn, and the more well-known you will probably become. This renown should be an altruistic byproduct and not an engineered goal. At a minimum, you might have more interesting things to put in your CV or talk about in interviews (if you get that far). Let's call it a form of enlightened self-interest.
  
  
## 2. The Underlay Problem

- [x] Your CV is a piece of marketing literature. It is self-written. You are on shaky ground to begin with unless you are a marketing guru and sales champion who knows their audience and their preferred medium intimately. So, become a temporary marketing expert, sales champion, and intimately know both your audience and medium.
- [x] Many hiring teams default to **distrust CVs** as people realize they are **[broken tokens](https://pansift.com/blog/why-cvs-and-resumes-are-broken/)** yet are still our least worst common currency. This is an open secret.
- [x] How can you actually prove your experience in advance of, or during an interview? This is your nut to crack or theirs to test you with. Apart from your attitude everything else is a vague and opaque approximation of condensed [Kabuki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabuki) theatre. 
- [x] The gendered [Confidence Gap](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/05/the-confidence-gap/359815/) is ongoing and pronounced. Confidence does not equal competence.
- [x] You are trying to overcome your own bias and that of others, this is a hard problem, don't give up. Language is important. Use it well and pay attention to theirs.
  
  
## 3. The Portfolio Problem (Proof of Experience)

- [x] Show don't tell. Can you actually show something or let them see and interact with something you've built? No? Build something. This is one reason why [FLOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) is good.
- [x] Have you got any video of yourself communicating or presenting? Video is also vulnerable to a hiring person's bias but it's better than having nothing. The benefits outweigh the drawbacks in terms of showing how you present and communicate. This favours extroverts but perhaps you could give a lightening talk at a local meetup group (and ask a friend to record it).
- [x] Is all your work 'Commercial in Confidence'? Well then, you better try to make or write up something outside of your work that you can share and show people (don't forget [#1](/blog/11-tips-tricks-and-tactics-to-get-hired/#1-the-noise-problem)).
  
    
## 4. The Ingestion Process

- [x] Is your CV going direct via email to a recruiter, sourcer, or the hiring manager? Or is it going via an upload on a web based form and being scraped for text and details?
- [x] Ask yourself how your CV makes it to the eyes of the hiring manager? Map it. Now hack the process, ethically. 
  
  
## 5. The Search Problem

- [x] Hiring platforms and webapps are not smart enough, yet. You can effectively [SEO(Search Engine Optimize)](https://pansift.com/blog/how-to-seo-hack-your-cv/) your CV, as most just use simple and limited **Boolean Search** including tools like so called 'X-Ray search' from [Recruitin](https://recruitin.net/) and standard [LinkedIn Search](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/75814/using-boolean-search-on-linkedin).
- [x] Algorithms also typically get trained on datasets that contain mostly male language patterns thus reinforcing male characteristics and attributes. Tools like [Textio](https://textio.com/) can help break this cycle by revealing unconscious [gender bias](https://textio.ai/watch-your-gender-tone-2728016066ec) early in both **Job Descriptions/Advertisements** and also in your **CV**.
- [x] Also the **Job Description** or **Position Description** that becomes the **Job Advertisement** is often inaccurate and itself just marketing literature (see above).
- [x] Even the new age of machine learning and so called **A.I.** is built on tainted datasets leading to badly trained algorithms. They use candidate written CV text (and look for simple keywords and keyphrases or use Natural Language Processing to extract dates, names, and skills) and many don't take in to account which CVs were actually successful for what roles (e.g. to teach the algorithms further about succesful applicants).
- [x] So there are A.I.s being trained on and matching **incorrect and incomplete Job Descriptions** with **candidate's self-written marketing flyers** that were tweaked for competitive landscapes.... hmmmm...

## 6. CV and Résumé Format

- [x] Short, sharp, and sweet - as a human recruiter may parse your CV '*flyer*' in less than 20 seconds at first glance. A machine will do it in microseconds... are you in or out of the funnel?
- [x] Your CV is a sales pitch in a competitive landscape, treat it as such.
- [x] Search for and pay attention to advice from people like [Evilrecruiter's: CV Do's and Don'ts](https://www.evilrecruiter.com/cv_advice/) and related privacy [post](https://www.evilrecruiter.com/maintaining-a-semblence-of-privacy-while-looking-for-a-job/)
- [x] Typos, misspellings, and bad grammar are unacceptable when services like automatic spell checkers and tools like [HemingwayApp](https://hemingwayapp.com/) and [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) exist. It's also a total **faux-pas** for engineering roles to have even one character out of place. Errors reflect your level of attention to detail, your ability to double check and enlist help, and of course it shows your professional writing and communication ability in the target language. **Your CV is a piece of marketing literature. A digital billboard for your services and experience**. Your CV is, for all intents and purposes, **you** (until you meet or connect with someone from the hiring team, hopefully IRL(In Real Life)).
- [x] The language you use is important and meaningful. You are conjuring up imagery in the mind of the reader who is screening you (or your CV has been translated to numbers and is now a candidate for the best fitting curve or spline in an algorithm).
  
  
## 7. ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) Keywords

- [x] If an agency or organisation already have your CV, you want it to **resurface** (as often as possible) when keywords are searched for open roles
- [x] What is your skills surface? Maximize it, ethically. You can [invisibly keyword stuff](https://pansift.com/blog/how-to-seo-hack-your-cv/) as long as keywords are valid. Software agents and algorithms doing parsing will read the text irrespective and index it.
  
  
## 8. Recruiters and Sourcers are Human

- [x] Is the recruiter via an agency or in-house? Why does it matter, well, what are they incentivized by and how? Understand this to understand how they are playing the game.
- [x] Is their strategy quality or quantity? Are they a cog in a giant machine or interested in building their companies brand with long term relationships? 
- [x] Are they reformatting your CV and sending it on? Are they actually sending through your cover letter? Has the recruiter "screened" you out and why? What can you improve upon? Ask for feedback. Call them. Don't default to email.
- [x] Short term focused recruiters may just be playing the numbers game (or are new at this) but long term focused recruiters could place you **2-3** times over **6-8** years. You might be worth 30-60K to them or more if they can tap **your** network too (see [#1](/blog/11-tips-tricks-and-tactics-to-get-hired/#1-the-noise-problem)).
- [x] Few actually act as your "agent" so don't deceive yourself that they are in there advocating or selling on your behalf as you might imagine.
- [x] Own your own outcomes. Manage your recruiter and set and agree bi-directional expectations and communication timelines.
- [x] Call your recruiter or coordinator frequently to check-in. If you don't have a voice relationship with a person, make it. Never rely on digital alone. Reinforce your existence.
- [x] Follow up. Follow up every **3-4** days unless you've both set a schedule already. Never stop following up until someone tells you to stop. Use the phone. Acknowledge with email.
- [x] Again, use the phone. This is your primary tool not your secondary. If you default to email you are both creating distance **intentionally**.
- [x] Meet your recruiter face to face IRL or at least via a video call. Reinforce you exist as a living breathing person and are not just an avatar at the end of an email.
  
  
## 9. Prime the Hiring Manager and Team

- [x] You really want the hiring manager to know your name in advance and to be asking for your details themselves or at least be expecting them as one of the candidates. See [#1](/blog/11-tips-tricks-and-tactics-to-get-hired/#1-the-noise-problem)
- [x] The hiring manager and hiring team should hear your name from multiple sources. It's helpful if internal employees (and/or wider industry circles) have heard of you, so shake the tree a little, nicely and get out there and mix it up a bit! See [#1](/blog/11-tips-tricks-and-tactics-to-get-hired/#1-the-noise-problem)
- [x] Figure out as much as you can about the hiring team and their backgrounds so you can show a level of interest and potential spot connections you were not aware of. Professional digital stalking of this nature is ok and to be expected.
- [x] It's both **what** you know **and who** you know (or who you can **get to know** or **get to know about you**). Try to get in touch with the **right people in the hiring team** sooner rather than later, even to just reasarch the role, company culture, and reality of the situation. 
- [x] Get in touch with as many people you know in the organisation (or could get in touch with) even if not part of the hiring team to find out what it's like to actually work there. This also has the benefit of showing you did your research. This is a bonus in interviews as it shows you are a self-starter and can add value by independently figuring out an environment.
- [x] When dealing with people you are also planting seeds for either this engagement or the next. Remember that people move organisations and jobs. A person is not a person, they are also gateways to clusters, tribes, and networks. Your messaging and name can benefit from network effects so 'always be seeding'. 
  
  
## 10. Referrals and Referees

- [x] The best way to get your CV seen and increase the time spent by the hiring team reviewing it is via referrals. You have to invest to gain social capital you can then spend. See the point about community (on and offline [#1](/blog/11-tips-tricks-and-tactics-to-get-hired/#1-the-noise-problem)).
- [x] Non-zero sum games (especially if there's a finders fee/bonus) work well, if someone stands to gain to have you possibly come on board.
- [x] The downside can be hiring in clusters or tribes creating homogeneity. Try and discern this early in your investigations.
- [x] References and referees only matter in the later stages or during character checks.
- [x] Always say "References on request". Everyone know's you've picked affirming people and sometimes these relationship change or their details and situations change.
  
  
## 11. Important Research

- [x] Find relevant people in the target organisation who you can talk to about the role (even if 2-3 degrees away from you on say LinkedIn) and get in touch with them via your contacts (or go hunting as per [#1](/blog/11-tips-tricks-and-tactics-to-get-hired/#1-the-noise-problem) ).
- [x] You can get or validate their professional emails via 'lead gen' and email enrichment tools if need be.
- [x] Do your homework and quickly skill up with **new** basics (even if listed as only desirable skills). This shows you are willing and able to learn, improve, and explore new areas autonomously. Show an interest in keeping up-to-date with your skills ecosystem and demonstrate self-directed learning with platforms like [Pluralsight](https://pluralsight.pansift.com)
- [x] Arm yourself with as much independent data as you can. Maybe you learn sooner rather than later you don't actually want this specific role or to be a part of an organisation of this type (unless you really have to!).
- [x] During the process of asking questions and connecting with a range of people around you new opportunities frquently present themselves! You just need to let people know you are looking, that you are open to new things, and give more than you take!
  
> If you really want this job, you need to work for it. Long gone are the days of point, shoot, and wait. Get off your ass and through *your own actions* (not others) collapse down the multiverse to the one with the greatest probability of you getting as far down the funnel as you can, ethically! **Own your outcomes. Carve your future**.
