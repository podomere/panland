## The Functionality of Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you may be assigned a Public IPv4 address such as ```181.94.101.115``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:a70e:42ff:80ae:cd1a:8f10:c5fb:cc2```. Verification can be done using [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying these addresses to non-technical individuals or mentioning MAC addresses like ```20:9e:c1:67:4e:69``` can be error-prone and complex. In addition, this method does not provide historical data, especially related to past issues.
## Navigating the Internet
When attempting to access a website like https://kertzmann.net, the first step is to reach a DNS server in order to convert the host portion (kertzmann) in combination with the Top Level Domain (net) of the URL into an IP address, such as ```179.36.120.189```. Your computer and browser include its type in all web requests, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; AOL 9.7; AOLBuild 4343.19; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; FunWebProducts)```
## The Significance of Default Gateways
Usually, your default gateway is an automatically configured address via DHCP. A typical default gateway could be ```192.0.0.240``` (although they typically end in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size) and this is where your computer forwards all its traffic to be routed to its destination. For ```IPv6```, we have an extensive guide available at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/) or you can verify using Mac or Linux.
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.240    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:f25d:d02f:285f:ebd2%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {77.56.158.19, 220.239.126.20}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 20:9e:c1:67:4e:69
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 1d:f8:03:4d:5d:f4
}</pre>




## Fixing Network Connectivity Issues
When it comes to sending data to your router, you may be utilizing either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Network Problems on Apple Devices
Regardless of whether you are running on OSX/macOS version ```10.15.7```, ```11.3.8```, or ```12.3.7```, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes essential, especially for teams that have adopted remote work or Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Tools
One tool that can be very handy on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can generate a wide range of logs, although many are only for a specific point in time in relation to wireless, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz``` for you. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` and it will give a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` manually. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
