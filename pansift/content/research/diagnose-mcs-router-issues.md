## A Tutorial on Internet Addressing

When it comes to the Internet, you might be assigned a Public IPv4 address such as ```49.51.237.121``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:222e:55fa:921:85ca:ef41:1ac4:7ddd```. It's possible to verify these addresses on [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, expressing these addresses, or even referencing MAC addresses like ```f8:12:d8:2c:13:ef```, can quickly become error-prone and complicated, especially for those who are not tech-savvy. Moreover, this method does not offer any historical data, particularly regarding past problems.
## A Guide to Accessing the Internet
In order to access a web page like https://durgan.info, your computer initially contacts a DNS server to convert the host portion (durgan) combined with the Top Level Domain (info) of the URL to an IP address, such as ```23.197.52.49```. Every web request from your computer and browser actually includes its type, such as <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2228.0 Safari/537.36```
## The Significance of Default Gateways
Your default gateway is typically an automatically assigned address through DHCP. It is usually a default gateway like ```10.239.29.215``` (though its final digits typically end in .1 or .254, depending on the scope size) to which your computer directs all its traffic to be routed onwards. For a comprehensive explanation of ```IPv6```, you can refer to our in-depth article on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). Alternatively, you can check on Mac or Linux using the following command:
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  10.239.29.215    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:c135:ebd2:6d27:8825%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {50.137.20.215, 251.13.103.96}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr f8:12:d8:2c:13:ef
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 90:51:e5:6d:d1:3c
}</pre>




## Fixing Connectivity Issues for Wired and Wireless Networks

When it comes to sending data to your router, you might be using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX Users
Regardless of whether you are on OSX or macOS versions like ```10.11.4```, ```11.3.9```, or ```12.3.1```, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these tools do not provide a set of correlated values over time, which is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes beneficial, particularly for teams that are remote or follow a Work From Anywhere (WFA) approach.
#### Helpful Scripts Already Available
One useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can also generate specific logs for troubleshooting. In addition to this, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although most of them are point-in-time logs related to wireless, similar to wdutil.

To run ```sysdiagnose``` in the background and generate logs in ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, you can use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, simply run ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` and follow the privacy warning prompt. Keep in mind that the file sizes can be around 300MB.
