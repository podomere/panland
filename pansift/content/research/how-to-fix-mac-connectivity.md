## Understanding Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address or an IPv6 address. The Public IPv4 address could be numbers like ```138.13.235.238```, while an IPv6 address may look like ```2000:4330:c1ef:8921:f08a:b4b0:c0f8:c469```. You can verify your address at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, for those not well-versed in technology, conveying these addresses, or even recalling MAC addresses like ```90:8d:ec:ef:9e:5c```, can be prone to errors and quickly become complicated. Furthermore, this method does not provide any historical data, especially during previous technical issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

When attempting to access a website, such as https://hettinger.co, the initial step is to reach a DNS server to convert the combination of the host portion (hettinger) and the Top Level Domain (co) of the URL into an IP address, such as ```121.163.225.106```. In all web requests, your computer and browser send their type as well, for example: 
```Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_3) AppleWebKit/537.75.14 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/7.0.3 Safari/7046A194A```
## Understanding the Significance of Default Gateways

Typically, your default gateway is an automatically configured address through DHCP. This default gateway, such as ```192.0.0.44``` (although they usually end in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size), is where your computer sends all its traffic to be routed onwards. For ```IPv6```, detailed information can be found in [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). On Mac or Linux, you can verify this through:

```bash
ifconfig
```
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.44    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:c23e:49:9d9a:e326%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {141.224.74.46, 13.193.76.82}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 90:8d:ec:ef:9e:5c
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 9e:49:a2:e3:f8:b6
}</pre>




## Troubleshooting Network Issues - Wired vs. Wireless
When it comes to transferring data to your router, you may be using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Solutions for Apple macOS / OSX Users
No matter which version of OSX/macOS you're using, whether it's ```10.12.4```, ```11.2.1```, or ```12.2.7```, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, especially for teams that embrace remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Tools
One useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump to the CLI of current wireless settings and can also generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs related to wireless, although much of it is point-in-time data similar to wdutil.

To run ```sysdiagnose``` in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, you can use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` and it will provide a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Cmd+Shift+G in Finder. Just be aware that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
