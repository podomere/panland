## Functioning of Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, individuals are assigned a Public IPv4 address like ```76.121.69.82``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:d8f0:5fe6:cf8f:57de:e17d:9d18:2355```. Verification of these addresses can be done through [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, for those not well-versed in technology, communicating these addresses or MAC addresses like ```8b:06:07:57:e6:88``` can be prone to errors and quickly become complicated. Additionally, this method does not provide any historical data, especially regarding previous issues that have arisen.
## Navigating the Internet
In order to access a webpage such as https://heathcote-koss.org, the initial step involves accessing a DNS server to convert the host portion (heathcote-koss) combined with the Top Level Domain (org) of the URL into an IP address such as ```130.36.97.172```. Each web request from your computer and browser includes its type, for example: ```Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; AOL 9.7; AOLBuild 4343.19; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; FunWebProducts)```
## Significance of Default Gateways
The default gateway is typically an automatically configured address via DHCP. Usually, a default gateway such as ```192.168.12.11``` is assigned (though they typically end in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size), and this is where your computer sends all its traffic to be routed onwards. For ```IPv6```, detailed instructions on how to fix connectivity can be found at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). On Mac or Linux, the status can be checked using: <br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.168.12.11    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   bb95:f8ec:e291:ef:1d9d:2080:9b21:1816%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {143.45.128.86, 157.194.53.5}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 8b:06:07:57:e6:88
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 1c:c6:ef:32:4e:68
}</pre>




## Fixing Connectivity Issues for Wired or Wireless Networks

When it comes to transmitting data to your router at the physical and data layer, you might be utilizing either a wired or a wireless (Wi-Fi) medium.
### Troubleshooting on Apple macOS / OSX Systems
Regardless of whether you are working on OSX/macOS version 10.13.5, 11.6.6, or 12.3.7, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, especially for teams that are embracing remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
A very useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Another comprehensive tool is the ```sysdiagnose``` tool, which can generate a wide range of logs related to wireless issues, although they are mostly point-in-time logs similar to the ones generated by wdutil.

You can run ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background, and it will write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz``` for you. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can run ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` (although there is not much interaction) and it will give a privacy warning. If not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` or use Finder with Cmd+Shift+G to locate the path. Just be mindful of the file sizes, which can be around 300MB more or less.
