## Understanding the Functioning of Internet Addresses

When using the Internet, individuals may have a Public IPv4 address, such as ```249.190.136.58```, or an IPv6 address, like ```2000:ab63:bb76:b8fd:7384:5a2f:5d88:d10```. It is possible to verify this information through [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, communicating these addresses, including MAC addresses like ```3f:2c:ce:2e:dc:03```, can be error-prone and complex for individuals with limited technical expertise. Moreover, it does not provide access to historical data, particularly relating to past issues.
## Navigating the Internet

To access a website, such as https://konopelski.com, an individual initially connects to a DNS server to translate the host portion (konopelski) combined with the Top Level Domain (com) of the URL into an IP address, such as ```190.208.84.233```. Furthermore, the computer and browser define their type with all web requests, for example: <br>```Opera/9.80 (X11; Linux i686; Ubuntu/14.10) Presto/2.12.388 Version/12.16```
## Significance of Default Gateways

Typically, the default gateway is an automatically configured address through DHCP. Individuals obtain a default gateway, such as ```192.0.0.36``` (although they usually end in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size), and this is where the computer sends all traffic to be routed onwards. To delve deeper into ```IPv6```, further information is available on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). In addition, individuals can perform checks on Mac or Linux using: <br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.36    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:e812:233d:2eeb:5fc6%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {229.201.130.57, 242.174.84.159}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 3f:2c:ce:2e:dc:03
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 08:12:c0:c9:4f:fa
}</pre>




## Repairing Connection Issues for Wired or Wireless Networks

When transmitting data to your router, you may be utilizing either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Steps to Resolve Connectivity Problems on Apple macOS / OSX
No matter which version of OSX/macOS you are currently using - whether it's 10.15.7, 11.1.7, or 12.1.8, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a set of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes crucial, especially for teams that embrace remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Integrated Utilities That Can Aid in Troubleshooting
One valuable tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of the current wireless settings to the Command Line Interface (CLI) and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting purposes. Furthermore, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although many of these are point-in-time only with regard to wireless, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz``` for you. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can execute ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will give a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. However, be mindful of the file sizes, which are approximately 300MB or less.
