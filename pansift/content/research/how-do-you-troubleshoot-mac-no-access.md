## Understanding Internet Addressing  

When using the Internet, you will be assigned a public IP address such as ```149.41.91.73``` for IPv4 or ```2000:49b5:9299:e95f:2264:7949:a2e8:1ef2``` for IPv6. You can verify your IP address at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, communicating these addresses, or even MAC addresses like ```da:31:4c:27:ad:54```, can be challenging for those who are not technically inclined. Moreover, this method does not provide historical data, particularly when dealing with past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web  
When accessing a website such as https://lakin.co, your device initially contacts a DNS server to convert the host portion (lakin) in combination with the Top Level Domain (co) of the URL to an IP address like ```182.217.34.11```. Additionally, your computer and browser include specific information in all web requests, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win 9x 4.90; SG; rv:1.9.2.4) Gecko/20101104 Netscape/9.1.0285```.
## The Significance of Default Gateways  
The default gateway is typically an address that is automatically configured via DHCP. This default gateway, such as ```10.181.201.126``` (usually ending in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size), is where your computer sends all its traffic to be routed onwards. For ```IPv6```, you can find detailed instructions on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), or check on Mac or Linux using the following command: <br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  10.181.201.126    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:b7fb:d49d:4fef:2b98%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {95.81.131.136, 140.230.224.103}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr da:31:4c:27:ad:54
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 51:59:0c:7d:53:b8
}</pre>




## Fixing Connection Issues for Wired and Wireless Networks

When it comes to sending data to your router, you have the option of using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of the version of OSX/macOS you are using, whether it's ```10.14.7```, ```11.0.2```, or ```12.3.7```, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these tools and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, especially for teams that accommodate remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Integrated Scripts That Offer Assistance
On OSX/macOS, the ```sudo wdutil info``` tool is quite useful as it provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool is more comprehensive and can generate a wide range of logs, although many of these are point-in-time records related to wireless, similar to wdutil.

To run ```sysdiagnose``` in the background and generate logs in ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. You can also run it *interactively* with the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, but be cautious of the large file sizes, around 300MB more or less.
