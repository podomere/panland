## Understanding the Function of Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 or IPv6 address, such as ```75.232.58.117``` or ```2000:69ce:b6a7:81c9:2feb:69cb:2e35:11c8```. You can verify this information at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). Communicating these addresses, or even referring to MAC addresses like ```b2:f0:9a:31:bb:ef```, can be prone to errors for those without technical knowledge and becomes complex. Furthermore, it does not provide any historical data, especially from previous issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

When attempting to access a website, such as https://barton-schimmel.com, the first step is to connect to a DNS server to convert the host portion (barton-schimmel) combined with the Top Level Domain (com) of the URL to an IP address, like ```85.44.241.58```. Additionally, your computer and browser send its type with all web requests, for example: ```Opera/9.80 (X11; Linux i686; Ubuntu/14.10) Presto/2.12.388 Version/12.16```
## Significance of Default Gateways

Your default gateway is typically an automatically configured address via DHCP, such as ```172.31.86.102``` (although they usually end in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size). This is where your computer routes all of its traffic. For ```IPv6```, a comprehensive guide on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/) is available, and you can verify it on Mac or Linux with the following command:
```bash
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  172.31.86.102    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:975a:8ea1:1a13:d033%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {94.186.254.75, 114.221.253.25}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr b2:f0:9a:31:bb:ef
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 2c:2b:f4:2b:4d:90
}</pre>




## Resolving Wired and Wireless Connectivity Issues
When it comes to sending data to your router, you may encounter issues at the physical and data layer, whether you are using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of your OSX/macOS version - be it 10.14.4, 11.6.6, or 12.0.3 - there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes beneficial, especially for teams that are engaged in remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Tools
A handy tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, though many are only point-in-time in relation to wireless, just like wdutil.

To run ```sysdiagnose``` in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, you can use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. Alternatively, you can run it *interactively* by using ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will prompt a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. However, keep in mind that the file sizes can be around 300MB.
