## Understanding Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address such as ```47.40.47.113``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:fa78:eeb8:b03c:cc8a:a573:b3e8:4987```. This can be verified at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, for those who are not well-versed in technology, conveying these addresses or even mentioning MAC addresses like ```09:97:96:8a:96:4d``` can lead to errors and become complex. Moreover, it does not provide any historical data, particularly for previous issues.
## Navigation on the Internet
Accessing a website such as https://corwin-bruen.com involves connecting to a DNS server to convert the combination of the host portion (corwin-bruen) and the Top Level Domain (com) of the URL to an IP address like ```242.38.213.189```. With every web request, your computer and browser sends its type, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; AOL 9.7; AOLBuild 4343.19; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; FunWebProducts)```
## Significance of Default Gateways
The default gateway is typically an automatically assigned address through DHCP. It usually ends in .1 or .254 depending on the scale and is where your computer directs all its traffic for routing. For ```IPv6```, a more detailed explanation is available at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). On Mac or Linux, you can verify this with:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.148    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:ce00:41ce:e923:922d%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {86.117.112.11, 17.212.158.168}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 09:97:96:8a:96:4d
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 03:d6:16:23:92:57
}</pre>




## Resolving Connectivity Issues for Wired and Wireless Networks

When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Solutions for Apple macOS / OSX Devices
Regardless of whether you are using OSX/macOS 10.15.8, 11.2.8, or 12.1.5, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes essential, particularly for teams engaged in remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Utilizing Built-in Scripts for Assistance
One useful tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific troubleshooting logs. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although many are only point-in-time related to wireless, similar to wdutil.

To run ```sysdiagnose``` in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. For an *interactive* version (although there is minimal interaction), run ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```. Be cautious of the file sizes, which are approximately 300MB.
