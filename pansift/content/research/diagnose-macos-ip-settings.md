## Explanation of Internet Addressing

When connecting to the internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4, such as ```189.36.104.179```, or an IPv6 address, for example ```2000:a036:1912:1cfb:1c98:9038:bc62:a99f```. You can verify your assigned address at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, for individuals not well-versed in technology, relaying and interpreting these addresses, as well as MAC addresses like ```ff:d6:06:b3:59:14```, can be prone to errors and become complex very quickly. Moreover, there is no access to historical data, especially regarding past issues that may have occurred.
## Navigating the Internet

When attempting to access a web page such as https://macgyver-halvorson.info, the first step is to contact a DNS server to translate the host part (macgyver-halvorson) combined with the Top Level Domain (info) of the URL into an IP address, typically a sequence like ```2.158.2.187```. Upon making web requests, your computer and browser transmits its type, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win 9x 4.90; SG; rv:1.9.2.4) Gecko/20101104 Netscape/9.1.0285```
## Significance of Default Gateways

Your default gateway is usually an automatically assigned address through DHCP. Typically, a default gateway might appear as ```192.0.0.78``` (with endings like .1 or .254 depending on the size of the scope), and this is where your computer forwards all its traffic for further routing. For ```IPv6```, detailed instructions can be found on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). Alternatively, on Mac or Linux, you can verify with the following command:
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.78    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:fb6:8557:8545:deff%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {227.7.71.78, 247.173.71.190}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr ff:d6:06:b3:59:14
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 80:f1:78:36:87:cf
}</pre>




## Resolving Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections

When transmitting data to your router, you may be utilizing either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Tips for Fixing Problems on Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of the version of OSX/macOS you are using, whether it's ```10.14.1```, ```11.4.5```, or ```12.3.9```, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, particularly for teams that embrace remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
One valuable tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump to the CLI of current wireless related settings and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only relevant to wireless at a specific point in time, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz``` for you. If you prefer to run it *interactively* (although there is minimal interaction), you can use the command<br>```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will prompt a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, allowing you to navigate to ```/var/tmp```, or use Finder with Cmd+Shift+G to locate the path. Keep in mind that the file sizes are typically around 300MB.
