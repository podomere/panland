## The Functionality of Internet Addressing

When browsing the internet, you are often assigned a Public IPv4 address such as ```61.243.101.56``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:6aa4:e962:c4a0:9e6b:bac7:7c22:c66d```. It is possible to verify this information at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, explaining these addresses or even mentioning MAC addresses like ```1d:40:83:c3:30:69```, can be error-prone and complex, particularly for those who are not tech-savvy. Moreover, this method does not provide any historical data, especially when previous issues occurred.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

In order to access a web page like https://durgan.org, you initially connect to a DNS server to convert the host section (durgan) combined with the Top Level Domain (org) of the URL into an IP address like ```163.210.184.19```. In every web request, your computer and browser will send its type, such as <br>```Opera/9.80 (X11; Linux i686; Ubuntu/14.10) Presto/2.12.388 Version/12.16```
## The Significance of Default Gateways

Typically, your default gateway is an automatically configured address via DHCP. For instance, you may receive a default gateway like ```172.24.50.255``` (although they usually end in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size), which is where your computer sends all of its traffic to be routed onwards. There is a detailed explanation for ```IPv6``` on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/) but you can check on Mac or Linux with:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  172.24.50.255    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:1bc:2b32:b7ba:b2ea%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {14.215.144.81, 37.1.196.84}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 1d:40:83:c3:30:69
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr b1:66:0a:6b:55:90
}</pre>




## Resolve Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
No matter which version of OSX/macOS you have, whether it's ```10.11.4```, ```11.4.8```, or ```12.3.6```, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts don't provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, particularly for teams that embrace remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
A very useful tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless related settings to the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only point in time in relation to wireless, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz``` for you. If you prefer to run it *interactively*, you can run<br>```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will give a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Just keep in mind that the file sizes are about 300MB or so.
