## Understanding Internet Addressing

When connecting to the Internet, you are assigned a unique Public IPv4 address like ```30.147.234.239``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:7cbb:60fb:4f5d:4caa:6ad7:f62a:dd48```. A convenient way to check this is through [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, communicating these addresses, or even MAC addresses like ```53:a9:01:63:d9:4c```, can be prone to errors and quickly become complex, especially for non-technical users. Moreover, it does not provide historical data, particularly for past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

Accessing a website such as https://stamm.info involves initially communicating with a DNS server to translate the host portion (stamm) combined with the Top Level Domain (info) of the URL, into an IP address like ```188.190.189.121```. In the process of sending web requests, your computer and browser relay their type, for instance  
```Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; AOL 9.7; AOLBuild 4343.19; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; FunWebProducts)```.
## Significance of Default Gateways

Typically obtained automatically through DHCP, your default gateway is essential for routing all of your computer's traffic. You are assigned a default gateway like ```192.168.144.185```, often ending in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size. More information on how to fix IPv6 connectivity can be found in our in-depth discussion at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). Verification on Mac or Linux systems can be done through:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.168.144.185    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:22f0:8fe4:609e:5696%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {131.22.87.182, 142.53.36.151}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 53:a9:01:63:d9:4c
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 06:0c:43:f7:57:6e
}</pre>




## Resolving Issues with Wired or Wireless Connectivity

When transmitting data to your router, you may be using either a wired or a wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX Users
Regardless of which version of OSX/macOS you are using - whether it's ```10.15.6```, ```11.4.2```, or ```12.1.6``` - there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. For this reason, automated remote troubleshooting is particularly valuable for teams that have adopted remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Effective Built-in Scripts for Troubleshooting
An extremely useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of current wireless settings in the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific troubleshooting logs. Furthermore, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate an extensive range of logs, although much of the information is only relevant to a specific point in time. To run it in the background and save logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, you can use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will provide a privacy warning and open Finder in the correct location. It's important to note that the file sizes can range from around 300MB.
