## Understanding Internet Address Assignments

When using the Internet, users are assigned various types of IP addresses, such as Public IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. These addresses can be verified through the use of platforms like [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying these addresses, especially to those not well-versed in technology, can be complex and error-prone. Furthermore, historical data on previous issues is not easily accessible.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

Accessing a website like https://dickens.org involves a process where a DNS server translates the host portion of the URL, along with the Top Level Domain, into an IP address. Each web request also includes detailed information about the user's computer and browser, such as ```Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; AOL 9.7; AOLBuild 4343.19; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; FunWebProducts)```.
## The Significance of Default Gateways

The default gateway, typically obtained through DHCP, serves as the designated address for routing all outgoing traffic from a computer. For ```IPv6``` connectivity issues, a comprehensive guide is available at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). Alternatively, users can perform checks on Mac or Linux systems using specific commands.
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.122    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:c448:d947:87be:fe4c%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {230.67.7.23, 118.83.222.10}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 51:75:91:59:99:d5
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 62:db:0c:4c:24:7c
}</pre>




## Resolving Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be utilizing either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Effective Solutions for Apple macOS / OSX Users
Regardless of the version of OSX/macOS you have, whether it's ```10.12.2```, ```11.0.1```, or ```12.0.5```, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a set of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes invaluable, especially for teams that embrace remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
One tool that macOS users can rely on is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the command line interface and can also generate specific logs for troubleshooting purposes. Another comprehensive tool is the ```sysdiagnose``` tool, which can generate a wide range of logs related to wireless issues, although the majority of the data is only relevant at a specific point in time, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will generate logs in ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```. For an *interactive* approach (although there is minimal interaction), you can run ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will prompt a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` or use Finder with Cmd+Shift+G to point Finder to the path. However, be mindful of the file sizes, which are around 300MB more or less.
