## Understanding the Functioning of Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, individuals may obtain a Public IPv4 address, such as ```116.81.6.184```, or an IPv6 address like ```2000:964d:ff43:8224:4631:605f:a388:1be5```. This information can be verified through [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, communicating these addresses, or even mentioning MAC addresses like ```b2:d1:24:97:de:48```, can be prone to errors and become complex, especially for those with limited technical knowledge. Moreover, this method does not provide any historical information, particularly when dealing with past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

In order to access a webpage, such as https://kling.biz, individuals initially connect to a DNS server to convert the host portion (kling) combined with the Top Level Domain (biz) of the URL to an IP address, for instance, ```151.13.2.34```. Each web request from a computer and browser includes the specified type, for example, <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_3) AppleWebKit/537.75.14 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/7.0.3 Safari/7046A194A```
## Significance of Default Gateways

The default gateway is typically an automatically assigned address via DHCP, such as ```192.0.0.194``` (although they generally end in .1 or .254 based on the scope size), and serves as the destination for routing all traffic from a computer. For ```IPv6```, detailed instructions can be found in the article [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). Additionally, on Mac or Linux, users can verify this information using:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.194    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:eb46:6577:ce56:6cd0%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {66.41.42.156, 151.60.214.135}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr b2:d1:24:97:de:48
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 16:0d:d3:0e:96:96
}</pre>




## Resolving Wired and Wireless Connectivity Issues
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX Users
Regardless of whether you are running OSX/macOS version ```10.15.9```, ```11.0.5```, or ```12.1.6```, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a set of correlated values over time, making automated remote troubleshooting crucial, particularly for teams practicing remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
A valuable tool for OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific troubleshooting logs. Furthermore, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool offers a comprehensive range of logs, although many are only relevant at a specific point in time in relation to wireless, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will generate logs in ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```. Alternatively, for an *interactive* run (although there is minimal interaction), you can use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will prompt a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G or through the path. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
