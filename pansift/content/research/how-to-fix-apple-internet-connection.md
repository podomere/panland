## Understanding Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address such as ```205.54.125.130``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:7ca0:c6f3:ab07:f2e1:9fe:f2aa:50b7```. You can verify this information by visiting [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, for individuals without technical expertise, communicating these addresses, or even referencing MAC addresses like ```74:bd:43:87:97:b8```, can be error-prone and quickly become complex. Moreover, this method does not provide any historical data, especially when dealing with past issues.
## Navigating the Internet

When trying to access a website, such as https://connelly.com, the process begins with contacting a DNS server to convert the host portion (connelly) and the Top Level Domain (com) of the URL into an IP address, like ```144.252.156.90```. Your computer and browser also include their specific types with all web requests, for example:
```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2228.0 Safari/537.36```
## The Significance of Default Gateways

The default gateway is typically an automatically configured address through DHCP. This gateway, such as ```172.31.5.121``` (commonly ending in .1 or .254 based on the scope size), serves as the destination for all the traffic sent from your computer to be routed onwards. For ```IPv6```, more detailed instructions are available by following this link: [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). Additionally, you can verify this information on Mac or Linux by using the command:
```<br>```
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  172.31.5.121    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:3457:8f3e:4ce6:a734%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {100.202.246.124, 63.161.147.40}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 74:bd:43:87:97:b8
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr e1:89:48:ff:8d:14
}</pre>




## Resolve Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections
When it comes to sending data to your router, you may be using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX Users
Regardless of the version of OSX/macOS you have, whether it's ```10.15.3```, ```11.0.9```, or ```12.2.1```, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, especially for teams that are embracing remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
One useful tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless related settings to the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only relevant to wireless settings at a specific point in time, similar to wdutil.

To run sysdiagnose in the background and generate logs in ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, you can use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will generate a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
