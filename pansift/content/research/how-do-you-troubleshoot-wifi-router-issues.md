## An Overview of Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, individuals may be assigned a Public IPv4 address such as ```32.197.146.68``` or an IPv6 address, such as ```2000:e0f7:c22c:ef34:178c:77de:904e:5ca1```. The status of these addresses can be verified at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, explaining these addresses to those who are not technically inclined, or identifying the MAC addresses like ```f7:97:46:5b:f9:5c```, can become complex and prone to errors. Furthermore, this method does not provide historical data, particularly for past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

When attempting to access a website such as https://sipes-denesik.info, the first step is contacting a DNS server to convert the host part (sipes-denesik) along with the Top Level Domain (info) of the URL into an IP address, such as ```89.52.78.181```. In each web request, your computer and browser transmit information about their type, for instance: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; AS; rv:11.0) like Gecko```
## Understanding the Significance of Default Gateways

By default, the default gateway is an address that is automatically configured through DHCP. An example of a default gateway address would be ```192.0.0.202``` (commonly ending in .1 or .254, depending on the scope size). This is the point to which your computer sends all of its traffic to be routed. For ```IPv6```, a more in-depth explanation can be found at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), or alternatively, it can be checked on Mac or Linux by using:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.202    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:e1d1:be7d:efc0:6116%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {137.134.13.128, 188.47.209.181}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr f7:97:46:5b:f9:5c
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr d4:65:3d:d5:dd:dc
}</pre>




## Fixing Connectivity Issues for Wired or Wireless Networks
When transmitting data to your router, you may be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX Users
Regardless of the version of OSX/macOS you are using, whether it's ```10.15.7```, ```11.4.8```, or ```12.3.2```, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time, which is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes invaluable, particularly for teams that are working remotely and embracing Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Utilizing Built-in Scripts for Assistance
A useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only point-in-time related to wireless, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```. Alternatively, if you prefer to run it interactively, you can use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, but be aware that it will give a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` or use Finder with Cmd+Shift+G to locate the path. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
