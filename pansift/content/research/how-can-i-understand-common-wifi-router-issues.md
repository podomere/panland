## Understanding the Function of Internet Addresses

When you connect to the internet, you are assigned a unique public IPv4 address, such as ```237.188.117.146```, or an IPv6 address like ```2000:85cc:c501:72d7:87fa:f063:3fd7:429f```. This information can be verified using [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying and interpreting these addresses, as well as MAC addresses like ```6f:e6:9d:2b:f0:38```, can be prone to errors and can become complex very quickly. Additionally, historical data about previous issues is not readily available.
## Navigating Web Content
When attempting to access a web page, such as https://abernathy.io, you first connect to a DNS server to convert the host portion (abernathy) and the Top Level Domain (io) of the URL into an IP address, such as ```106.89.154.140```. Additionally, your computer and browser send specific information with each web request, such as the type of browser being used: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; AOL 9.7; AOLBuild 4343.19; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; FunWebProducts)```
## Significance of Default Gateways
By default, your default gateway address is automatically configured through DHCP. This address, such as ```192.168.65.67``` (commonly ending in .1 or .254 based on scope size), is where your computer directs all of its traffic for routing. For ```IPv6```, a detailed explanation can be found in our post [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/) or you can use Mac or Linux to check using:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.168.65.67    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:afce:c499:8975:905b%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {200.193.109.183, 157.249.213.16}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 6f:e6:9d:2b:f0:38
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 9b:ea:25:55:be:2c
}</pre>




## Resolving Connectivity Issues: Wired or Wireless Networks
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be utilizing either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Steps for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of the version of OSX/macOS you are running, whether it's ```10.13.9```, ```11.6.4```, or ```12.0.5```, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes especially valuable, particularly for teams that are engaged in remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Utilizing Built-in Scripts for Assistance
One useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of the current wireless settings to the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific troubleshooting logs. Moreover, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is specific to a particular point in time in relation to wireless, similar to wdutil.

To run it in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it *interactively* (although there is minimal interaction), you can use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will prompt a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
