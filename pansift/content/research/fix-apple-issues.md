## The Functionality of Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you can be assigned a Public IPv4 address such as ```191.202.129.154``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:1d4c:897:6290:97f2:b640:a4b3:8147```. To confirm this, you can visit [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying these addresses to those who are not well-versed in technology, or even mentioning MAC addresses like ```de:9f:4b:94:9b:d6```, can lead to errors and become complex. Moreover, this does not provide historical data, especially from previous issues.
## Navigating the Internet
In order to reach a website like https://rippin-lehner.info, your device initially contacts a DNS server to convert the host portion (rippin-lehner) in combination with the Top Level Domain (info) of the URL to an IP address such as ```99.235.9.234```. Additionally, your computer and browser includes its type with all web requests e.g. <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; AS; rv:11.0) like Gecko```
## The Significance of Default Gateways
The default gateway is typically an automatically assigned address via DHCP. You receive a default gateway like ```172.25.144.162``` (although they typically end in .1 or .254 based on the scope size) and this is where your computer sends all its data to be routed further. For ```IPv6```, you can find more detailed information on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), or you can verify on Mac or Linux using

### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  172.25.144.162    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:1cd3:6892:8684:4d0%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {2.114.140.239, 137.111.187.118}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr de:9f:4b:94:9b:d6
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 82:fb:75:62:b2:72
}</pre>




## Fixing Wired and Wireless Connectivity Issues
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of the version of OSX/macOS you have, whether it's ```10.13.1```, ```11.3.4```, or ```12.3.3```, there are a variety of troubleshooting tools available. However, manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes crucial, especially for teams that practice remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts for Troubleshooting 
One useful tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Moreover, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a comprehensive set of logs related to wireless issues, although much of it is only point-in-time data similar to wdutil.

To run it in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` manually. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
