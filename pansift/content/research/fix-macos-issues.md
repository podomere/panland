## Understanding Internet Addressing

When browsing the internet, you are assigned a unique Public IPv4 address, such as ```52.158.7.65```, or an IPv6 address like ```2000:5113:3324:43bf:7d95:127b:1cec:dd1c```. A quick way to check this is through [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying these addresses, or even MAC addresses like ```3c:5f:41:29:5a:c2```, in a non-technical manner can be prone to errors and quickly become complicated. Moreover, this method does not provide any historical data, especially when dealing with past issues.
## Navigating the Internet
To access a website like https://murphy-gutkowski.name, your computer initially contacts a DNS server to translate the host portion (murphy-gutkowski) combined with the Top Level Domain (name) of the URL to an IP address such as ```8.168.23.248```. Your computer and browser also transmit its type with all web requests, as illustrated by <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_3) AppleWebKit/537.75.14 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/7.0.3 Safari/7046A194A```.
## The Significance of Default Gateways
The default gateway is typically an automatically configured address through DHCP, such as ```192.0.0.83``` (usually ending in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size), where your computer sends all its traffic to be routed onwards. For more information on ```IPv6```, detailed instructions can be found at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). On Mac or Linux, you can verify this with the following command:<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.83    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:bf79:9308:c9ca:d1c9%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {30.80.194.35, 79.35.128.124}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 3c:5f:41:29:5a:c2
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 3d:c1:2a:83:4c:ce
}</pre>




## Resolve Problems with Wired or Wireless Connections
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you could be using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Tips for Apple macOS / OSX Users
Regardless of whether you are running OSX/macOS version 10.11.9, 11.6.6, or 12.2.6, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts don't provide a set of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting can be especially useful, particularly for teams that embrace remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
One incredibly useful tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only pertinent to wireless at a specific point in time, similar to wdutil.

To run it in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it *interactively* (although there is minimal interaction), use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` and be prepared for a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder or Cmd+Shift+G. Just be mindful of the file sizes, which are typically around 300MB.
