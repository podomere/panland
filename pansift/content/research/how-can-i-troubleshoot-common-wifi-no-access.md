## Understanding Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you will be assigned a Public IPv4 address such as ```156.242.127.166``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:a85d:b9d3:1d0d:d153:20cf:bc93:ad9```. This assignment can be verified by visiting [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). Communicating these addresses, or even referring to MAC addresses like ```e1:47:07:96:5f:00```, can be complex and error-prone, especially for those not well-versed in technology. Moreover, this method does not provide any historical data, which can be crucial when troubleshooting past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web
When trying to access a website such as https://white-thiel.com, your computer first connects to a DNS server to convert the host portion (white-thiel) and the Top Level Domain (com) of the URL into an IP address, for example, ```238.239.68.43```. Your computer and browser also include its type in all web requests, such as <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; AOL 9.7; AOLBuild 4343.19; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; FunWebProducts)```
## Significance of Default Gateways
The default gateway, usually assigned automatically via DHCP, serves as the access point for all outbound traffic from your computer. This gateway, like ```192.168.181.107``` (although typically ending in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size), is where your computer sends all its traffic to be routed onwards. For ```IPv6```, detailed information is available in our article [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). On Mac or Linux, you can check this using the following command:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.168.181.107    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:5c88:ce0:2390:ce2b%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {255.28.236.189, 189.220.99.209}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr e1:47:07:96:5f:00
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 48:b3:cc:5f:2c:a7
}</pre>




## Resolving Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections

When it comes to transferring data to your router, you may be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX Users
No matter which version of OSX/macOS you are currently using, be it ```10.15.3```, ```11.2.5```, or ```12.0.3```, there exist a variety of tools for troubleshooting. However, the manual actions and scripts available do not provide a set of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes invaluable, especially for teams that have adopted remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Utilizing Pre-installed Scripts for Assistance
One immensely useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump to the CLI of current wireless settings and can also be configured to generate specific troubleshooting logs. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only relevant to wireless settings at a specific point in time, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` will execute the tool in the background, writing logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```. For an *interactive* run (although there is minimal interaction involved), you can execute ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will prompt a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Just be mindful of the file sizes, which can be approximately 300MB.
