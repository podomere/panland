## Understanding Internet Addressing

When it comes to the Internet, you may have a Public IPv4 address such as ```44.93.44.100``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:24eb:6025:2804:6015:a64e:acfb:8e42```. It is possible to verify this information by visiting [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, for individuals who are not technologically savvy, conveying these addresses, or even mentioning MAC addresses like ```a0:cb:86:9a:c5:5c```, can become prone to error and quickly become complex. Furthermore, this does not provide any historical data, especially relevant to past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

To access a website such as https://denesik.info, the initial step involves accessing a DNS server to convert the host portion (denesik) combined with the Top Level Domain (info) of the URL into an IP address, such as ```3.251.180.6```. When making web requests, your computer and browser actually send their type, for example: 
```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT x.y; Win64; x64; rv:10.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0```
## Understanding the Significance of Default Gateways

The default gateway is typically an automatically configured address via DHCP. You obtain a default gateway like ```192.168.164.124``` (although they typically end in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size), and this is where your computer sends all of its traffic to be routed onward. For ```IPv6```, there is an in-depth guide available on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), but it is possible to check on Mac or Linux with:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.168.164.124    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:be78:d0fd:811e:285e%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {226.100.35.207, 158.89.85.160}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr a0:cb:86:9a:c5:5c
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr db:3e:8c:c3:aa:ba
}</pre>




## Troubleshooting Connectivity Issues: Wired vs Wireless
When it comes to sending data to your router, you'll likely be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Solving Problems on Apple macOS / OSX
No matter which version of OSX/macOS you're using - whether it's ```10.11.6```, ```11.3.3```, or ```12.1.6``` - there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, especially for teams that embrace remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
On OSX/macOS, the ```sudo wdutil info``` tool is quite helpful as it provides a dump of the current wireless settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific troubleshooting logs. Another comprehensive tool is the ```sysdiagnose```, which can generate a wide range of logs related to wireless, though many are only point-in-time logs just like wdutil.

To run ```sysdiagnose``` in the background and have it write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. For an *interactive* run, use ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` with a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
