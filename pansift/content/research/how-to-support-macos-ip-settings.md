## Understanding Internet Protocol Addresses

When using the Internet, you are assigned an IP address, such as ```221.235.161.206``` for IPv4 or ```2000:6983:97c2:23b6:a922:9d1:87e5:c9d3``` for IPv6. To check your IP address, you can visit [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying and comprehending these addresses, as well as MAC addresses like ```11:6f:21:1c:39:0f```, can be challenging for non-technical individuals. Furthermore, these addresses do not provide any historical data, especially during previous issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web
When accessing a website, such as https://reilly-beatty.net, the process begins by contacting a DNS server to convert the host portion (reilly-beatty) along with the Top Level Domain (net) of the URL into an IP address like ```251.189.23.122```. Your computer and browser send their type along with all web requests, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2228.0 Safari/537.36```
## Significance of Default Gateways
The default gateway is typically an automatically configured address via DHCP. This default gateway, such as ```192.168.58.54``` (typically ending in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size) is where your computer directs all its traffic to be routed onwards. For ```IPv6```, you can find detailed instructions on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), but you can also verify it on Mac or Linux by using:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.168.58.54    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:8da5:a2bc:52b0:637%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {84.79.235.155, 112.117.249.156}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 11:6f:21:1c:39:0f
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 7b:28:cc:01:b3:1e
}</pre>




## Resolve Connection Issues in Wired or Wireless Networks
When it comes to sending data to your router, you have the option to use a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Steps for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of the version of OSX/macOS you are using, whether it's 10.15.8, 11.3.3, or 12.3.6, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, especially for teams that embrace remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
On OSX/macOS, the ```sudo wdutil info``` tool is very helpful as it provides a dump of the current wireless settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Another tool, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool, can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although it is limited to point-in-time data related to wireless, similar to wdutil.

To run ```sysdiagnose``` in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, you can use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. Alternatively, you can run it interactively by using the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will give a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Keep in mind that the file sizes are around 300MB more or less.
