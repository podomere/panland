## Understanding Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address, such as ```0.105.146.51```, or an IPv6 address, like ```2000:9e03:ce0e:fbd3:3a21:e0be:8b8d:cb00```. [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/) can help you verify your address. However, explaining and sharing these addresses, as well as MAC addresses like ```26:e8:f4:7a:6f:98```, can be prone to errors and quickly become complicated, especially for those who are not technically inclined. Furthermore, this method does not provide historical data, particularly during previous issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

In order to access a website such as https://luettgen.name, you first need to contact a DNS server to convert the host part (luettgen) together with the Top Level Domain (name) of the URL into an IP address, like ```33.24.250.57```. Your computer and browser send their type along with every web request, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; AOL 9.7; AOLBuild 4343.19; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; FunWebProducts)```
## The Significance of Default Gateways

Your default gateway is typically an automatically configured address through DHCP. It usually ends in .1 or .254, depending on the scope size, such as ```192.168.165.175```, and is where your computer forwards all of its traffic for routing. For ```IPv6```, detailed instructions can be found in our blog post [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), but on Mac or Linux, you can verify this by: <br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.168.165.175    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:82a7:883a:eac8:e603%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {240.114.203.248, 86.249.235.212}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 26:e8:f4:7a:6f:98
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 3b:f2:25:c6:2b:40
}</pre>




## Troubleshooting Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections
When it comes to sending data to your router, you may be using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Tips for Managing Issues on Apple macOS / OSX
No matter which version of OSX/macOS you're running - whether it's 10.15.1, 11.3.5, or 12.3.7 - there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes essential, especially for teams embracing remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Tools
One incredibly useful tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI, and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only relevant to wireless settings, similar to wdutil.

To run it in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it *interactively*, use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will give a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. However, be aware of the file sizes, which can be around 300MB.
