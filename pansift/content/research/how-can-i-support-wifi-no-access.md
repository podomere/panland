## Functioning of Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you may have a Public IPv4 address such as ```19.73.241.212``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:8a50:a908:5a02:1db5:8f2:c7bd:d855```. These can be verified at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, for individuals who are not tech-savvy, trying to convey these addresses or even citing MAC addresses like ```a1:73:08:1b:b5:12``` can lead to errors and complexities. Furthermore, this method does not provide any historical data, particularly for past issues.
## Procedure for Accessing the Web

In order to access a web page such as https://weber-mante.biz, an initial step involves accessing a DNS server to convert the combination of the host portion (weber-mante) with the Top Level Domain (biz) of the URL into an IP address, for example ```180.180.136.3```. When making web requests, your computer and browser convey their type, for instance <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT x.y; Win64; x64; rv:10.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0```
## Significance of Default Gateways

Normally, your default gateway is an automatically configured address through DHCP. You are provided with a default gateway like ```192.168.66.115``` (usually ending in .1 or .254 based on the scope size), and this is where your computer directs all its traffic to be further routed. For ```IPv6```, detailed information is available at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/) but on Mac or Linux you can check using:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.168.66.115    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:de53:98f:4c18:7e9b%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {109.215.36.73, 202.75.210.19}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr a1:73:08:1b:b5:12
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 70:c4:6a:10:21:8b
}</pre>




## Fixing Connection Issues - Wired vs. Wireless
When it comes to sending data to your router, you might be using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Tips for Troubleshooting on Apple macOS / OSX
No matter which version of OSX/macOS you have, whether it's ```10.14.3```, ```11.1.3```, or ```12.0.8```, there are various tools available for addressing connection issues. However, these manual methods and scripts do not provide a set of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, particularly for teams that are embracing remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Utilizing Built-in Scripts for Assistance
An extremely useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump to the CLI of current wireless settings and can also generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Furthermore, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to produce a wide range of logs, although much of it is only point-in-time in relation to wireless, similar to wdutil.

To run ```sysdiagnose``` in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. For an interactive approach, you can run ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` and it will display a privacy warning. If not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` or use Finder with Cmd+Shift+G to locate the path. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
