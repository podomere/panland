## Understanding Internet Protocol Addressing

In the world of the Internet, you are assigned an IPv4 address, such as ```16.246.178.176```, or an IPv6 address, like ```2000:5133:a306:7175:8d5c:b59a:656a:4a8e```. You can verify these addresses by visiting [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying these addresses to individuals who are not well-versed in technological matters can be prone to errors and become complex. Furthermore, this method provides no historical data, especially during past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

When attempting to reach a webpage, such as https://ward.info, you must first access a DNS server to translate the host (ward) and the Top Level Domain (info) of the URL into an IP address, such as ```233.173.144.130```. Every web request from your computer and browser includes information about its type, such as <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; AOL 9.7; AOLBuild 4343.19; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; FunWebProducts)```
## Significance of Default Gateways

The default gateway is typically an address that is configured automatically via DHCP. It could be a default gateway like ```10.218.109.198``` (usually ending in .1 or .254, depending on the scope size) where your computer directs all its traffic to be routed. For ```IPv6```, a detailed guide on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/) is available, and you can check this on Mac or Linux with:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  10.218.109.198    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:5ffc:830d:4d78:6980%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {138.223.86.1, 218.200.140.49}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr a8:6f:5f:35:69:89
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 87:81:52:3e:20:a3
}</pre>




## Resolving Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections
When it comes to transferring data to your router, you have the option of using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX Users
No matter which version of OSX/macOS you are currently using - whether it's ```10.12.3```, ```11.0.8```, or ```12.2.7``` - there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a set of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes crucial, particularly for teams that have adopted remote work and the Work From Anywhere (WFA) approach.
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
One of the valuable tools on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. In addition, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can generate a wide range of logs, although most of them are only relevant to a specific point in time in relation to wireless, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```. If you prefer to run it *interactively*, you can use ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will prompt a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Cmd+Shift+G in Finder. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
