## Understanding Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 or IPv6 address. These addresses can be checked using tools like [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, for those who are not technologically inclined, communicating these addresses can be prone to error and quite complex. Moreover, it does not provide any historical data of previous issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

Accessing a website, such as https://dare-schmidt.co, involves first connecting to a DNS server to translate the host portion and the Top Level Domain of the URL into an IP address. Additionally, your computer and browser send specific information with each web request.
## Understanding the Significance of Default Gateways

The default gateway, typically obtained through DHCP, is where your computer forwards all its traffic. Whether it is an IPv4 or IPv6 address, understanding and configuring the default gateway is crucial for proper network connectivity.
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  10.26.46.207    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:4397:494f:daea:e73e%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {17.46.54.236, 198.98.116.159}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr ae:13:fa:de:6c:2b
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 90:44:77:89:c2:e7
}</pre>




## Solutions for Dealing with Wired and Wireless Connectivity Issues

When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Tips for Troubleshooting on Apple macOS

No matter which version of OSX/macOS you are running, whether it's ```10.14.3```, ```11.1.7```, or ```12.1.2```, there are a variety of troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, especially for teams that embrace remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Effective Built-in Tools for Assistance

An extremely helpful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of the current wireless settings to the CLI and can also generate specific logs for troubleshooting purposes. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be utilized to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only point-in-time data related to wireless, similar to wdutil.

To run sysdiagnose in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```. Be aware that the file sizes are approximately 300MB or more. If not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G.
