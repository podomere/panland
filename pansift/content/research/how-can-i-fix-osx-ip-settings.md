## The Functionality of Internet Addressing

When connecting to the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address such as ```25.19.15.70``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:792a:5710:9a6c:56e1:94a9:a735:c5ff```. These addresses can be verified at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/), but conveying them to non-technical individuals or referencing MAC addresses like ```eb:a1:14:9d:de:49``` can lead to mistakes and complexity. There is also a lack of historical data, especially concerning prior issues.
## Navigating the Internet
When accessing a website like https://collins.name, the first step is to connect to a DNS server to translate the host portion (collins) along with the Top Level Domain (name) of the URL to an IP address such as ```140.56.204.241```. Additionally, your computer and browser send specific type information with each web request such as <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT x.y; Win64; x64; rv:10.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0```
## The Significance of Default Gateways
The default gateway is typically an automatically assigned address via DHCP, such as ```192.0.0.181``` (often ending in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size). This is where your computer directs all traffic to be routed onwards. For ```IPv6```, a comprehensive guide on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/) is available, and on Mac or Linux, this can be verified with: <br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.181    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:f04e:c77f:84a1:daf4%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {15.185.107.131, 80.65.19.201}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr eb:a1:14:9d:de:49
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 25:e6:86:43:b7:52
}</pre>




## Resolving Issues with Wired or Wireless Connection
When it comes to sending data to your router, you might use a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Tips for Apple macOS / OSX Troubleshooting
Regardless of whether you are using OSX/macOS versions like ```10.12.6```, ```11.4.4```, or ```12.3.4```, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time, which is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes essential, especially for teams that adopt remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
A helpful tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump to the CLI of current wireless related settings and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a variety of logs, although most are point-in-time only in relation to wireless, similar to wdutil.

To run it in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. For an interactive experience, you can run ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will open Finder in the correct location or allow you to navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Cmd+Shift+G in Finder. Keep in mind that the file sizes are around 300MB more or less.
