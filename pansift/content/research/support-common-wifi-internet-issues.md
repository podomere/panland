## Understanding Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address, such as ```31.255.132.36```, or an IPv6 address, like ```2000:303e:816b:c9c5:34d:2c0a:df44:f669```. This information can be verified on [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying these addresses or MAC addresses like ```ad:99:88:2b:f9:6d``` to non-technical individuals can lead to errors and complexity, especially without access to historical data.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

Accessing a web page, such as https://hegmann.biz, requires communication with a DNS server that translates the host portion (hegmann) and the Top Level Domain (biz) of the URL into an IP address, such as ```163.190.181.169```. Furthermore, your computer and browser include its type in all web requests, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; AOL 9.7; AOLBuild 4343.19; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; FunWebProducts)```
## Significance of Default Gateways

The default gateway is typically an automatically configured address via DHCP and is often assigned as ```10.208.143.30``` (though the address may end in .1 or .254, based on the scope size). This is where your computer sends all its traffic to be routed onward. For ```IPv6```, detailed troubleshooting information can be found in our [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), and instructions to check on Mac or Linux are also available.
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  10.208.143.30    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:ae7:86b7:6546:6079%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {161.56.67.116, 206.243.229.77}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr ad:99:88:2b:f9:6d
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr dc:b7:94:f8:a0:56
}</pre>




## How to Resolve Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections
When it comes to sending data to your router, you might be utilizing a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting on Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of whether you are using ```10.13.5```, ```11.4.2```, or ```12.1.4```, OSX/macOS provides a variety of tools for addressing issues. However, these manual actions and scripts do not offer a set of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, particularly for teams that embrace remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
A useful tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only relevant to wireless settings at a specific point in time, similar to wdutil.

To run ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```. You can also run it *interactively* by using ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will give a privacy warning. If not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
