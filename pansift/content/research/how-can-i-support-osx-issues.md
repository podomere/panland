## Understanding the Functioning of Internet Addresses

When using the Internet, individuals may receive a Public IPv4 address, such as ```47.69.69.137```, or an IPv6 address, like ```2000:5b80:bd21:bd5:297b:90d3:512e:d6ef```. Verification can be done at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying these addresses to those not well-versed in technology, and even mentioning MAC addresses like ```da:0e:b2:50:9f:2a```, can lead to errors and complexities. Furthermore, this method does not provide historical data, particularly from past issues.
## Navigating the Internet

To access a website, such as https://gusikowski.name, one must initially connect to a DNS server in order to convert the host section (gusikowski) combined with the Top Level Domain (name) of the URL to an IP address, such as ```35.221.29.31```. With each web request, the system and browser essentially transmits its type, like <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; AOL 9.7; AOLBuild 4343.19; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; FunWebProducts)```
## Significance of Default Gateways

The default gateway is usually an address configured automatically via DHCP. A typical default gateway, such as ```10.203.195.19``` (usually ending in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size), is where a computer forwards all its traffic for routing. Specifically for ```IPv6```, there is an elaborate outline available at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). On Mac or Linux, the verification process can be performed with:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  10.203.195.19    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:8be3:4416:a6dc:f984%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {107.223.114.240, 84.106.88.130}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr da:0e:b2:50:9f:2a
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr c7:be:9a:a8:99:c2
}</pre>




## Resolving Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be using either a wired or a wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Techniques for Apple macOS / OSX
No matter which version of OSX/macOS you are currently using - whether it's ```10.12.9```, ```11.0.3```, or ```12.2.8``` - there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time, which is where the importance of automated remote troubleshooting becomes evident, especially for teams that have adopted remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA) practices.
#### Utilizing Built-in Scripts for Assistance
One valuable tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI, and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting purposes. Moreover, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only relevant to wireless settings at a specific point in time, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```. Alternatively, if you want to run it interactively, you can execute ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` and it will prompt a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
