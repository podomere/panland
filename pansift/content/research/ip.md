# Internet Addressing
On the Internet you might get a Public IPv4 address like **64.31.56.47** or an IPv6 address like **1af1:263d:96a5:6cd1:8d1d:3f72:ecb4:5595**. We can check this from [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). Yet, for 'non-techies' to try and communicate these addresses, or even call out MAC addresses like **98:7b:5d:5c:7f:67**, it's error prone and gets complicated quickly. Additionally, this doesn't give you any historical data (especially back when previous problems occured).

# Accessing the Web
To get to a web page like https://hodkiewicz-beatty.io you initially access a DNS server to translate the host portion (hodkiewicz-beatty) combined with the Top Level Domain io of the URL, to an IP address like **109.240.67.56**. 

# Default Gateways
Your default gateway is normally an automatically configured address via DHCP. You get a default gateway like **172.30.107.197** (though they normally end in .1 or .254 depending upon the scope size) and this is where your computer sends all its traffic to be routed onwards. For **IPv6** we have a deep dive on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/).

# Wired or Wireless
At the physical and data layer you may be using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium to send this data towards your router. 

# Apple macOS / OSX
No matter what version you are on, **10.12.4**, **11.1.3**, or **12.0.5**, there are a range of tools for troubleshooting but between manual actions and scripts, they don't give you a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting comes in to its own, especialy for teams that embrace remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
