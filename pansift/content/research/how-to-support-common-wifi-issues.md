## Understanding Internet Protocol Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned a unique Public IPv4 address such as ```81.54.215.218``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:709b:626d:3285:1ec4:40c2:c685:4c9f```. To verify your assigned address, you can visit [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, attempting to convey these addresses to individuals who are not familiar with technology, or even mentioning MAC addresses like ```da:d2:ee:62:06:e1```, can be prone to errors and can become complicated very quickly. It also does not provide any historical data, especially when dealing with past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web
When accessing a webpage such as https://bauch-schinner.name, your request is initially routed to a DNS server to translate the host part (bauch-schinner) combined with the Top Level Domain (name) of the URL to an IP address such as ```183.117.222.7```. Interestingly, your computer and browser sends its type with all web requests, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win 9x 4.90; SG; rv:1.9.2.4) Gecko/20101104 Netscape/9.1.0285```
## The Significance of Default Gateways
Your default gateway is typically an address that is auto-configured via DHCP. This default gateway, which may end in .1 or .254 based on the scope size, such as ```10.113.152.6```, is where your computer sends all its traffic to be routed onwards. For ```IPv6```, you can find more detailed information on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). On Mac or Linux, the default gateway can be checked using:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  10.113.152.6    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:878d:bc87:33a1:d83b%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {113.91.67.221, 25.205.101.27}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr da:d2:ee:62:06:e1
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 99:1a:f7:5c:a4:f6
}</pre>




## Resolve Issues with Wired or Wireless Connections

When transmitting data, you may utilize either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium to communicate with your router at the physical and data layer.
### Tips for Troubleshooting on Apple macOS / OSX
No matter which version of OSX/macOS you are using, whether it's ```10.14.5```, ```11.1.7```, or ```12.2.8```, there are various tools available for resolving issues. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a continuous set of correlated values over a period of time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes invaluable, particularly for teams that are embracing remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
One useful tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Another comprehensive tool is the ```sysdiagnose``` tool, which can generate a wide range of logs, although many of them are only relevant to a specific point in time in relation to wireless, similar to wdutil.

To run it in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, you can use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, but beware of the large file sizes of about 300MB or more.
