## Functioning of Internet Addressing

Internet addresses come in two main forms: Public IPv4 like ```188.140.39.70``` and IPv6 like ```2000:387b:4ae8:981c:562d:3b5:32c6:fc12```. You can verify your internet address at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying these addresses to non-technical individuals or referencing MAC addresses such as ```32:b9:5f:f2:ef:b7``` can be prone to errors and quickly become complex. Moreover, this method does not provide any historical data, especially from past incidents.
## Web Page Access
When attempting to reach a web page such as https://robel.biz, the initial step involves accessing a DNS server to translate the host (robel) combined with the Top Level Domain (biz) of the URL into an IP address such as ```40.71.198.157```. Your computer and browser specifies its type with every web request, for example: <br>```Opera/9.80 (X11; Linux i686; Ubuntu/14.10) Presto/2.12.388 Version/12.16```
## Significance of Default Gateways
The default gateway is usually an automatically configured address via DHCP. It typically ends in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size and serves as the destination for all outgoing traffic from your computer. For insights into ```IPv6```, refer to our in-depth guide on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). On Mac or Linux, you can check this with:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  172.24.60.172    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:2c39:4688:d56e:2e8d%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {77.147.56.74, 22.122.151.62}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 32:b9:5f:f2:ef:b7
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 30:41:33:98:c6:b3
}</pre>




## Resolving Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections

When you are transmitting data to your router, you might be using either a wired or a wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of the version of OSX/macOS you are using, whether it's ```10.11.2```, ```11.4.6```, or ```12.0.4```, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes essential, especially for teams that support remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Utilizing Built-in Scripts for Assistance
A highly useful tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Moreover, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a comprehensive range of logs, although much of it is only relevant to wireless settings, similar to wdutil.

To run it in the background and generate logs in ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, you can use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will display a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` manually or use Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
