## Understanding Internet Addressing Principles

When using the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address, such as ```185.214.214.47```, or an IPv6 address, like ```2000:4c0d:1e7c:519a:d658:1e7d:dd73:b97e```. You can verify this information by visiting [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, for individuals who are not well-versed in technology, conveying these addresses or identifying MAC addresses, such as ```ea:46:0b:87:96:ab```, can be error-prone and complex. Furthermore, this method does not provide historical data, especially when looking back at past issues.
## Navigating the Internet

In order to access a web page like https://jakubowski-heaney.org, you must first contact a DNS server to convert the host portion (jakubowski-heaney) combined with the Top Level Domain (org) of the URL into an IP address, such as ```241.248.39.247```. Additionally, when making web requests, your computer and browser send their type, for example: <br>```Opera/9.80 (X11; Linux i686; Ubuntu/14.10) Presto/2.12.388 Version/12.16```
## Understanding the Significance of Default Gateways

Your default gateway is typically an automatically assigned address via DHCP, such as ```172.21.2.38``` (usually ending in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size). This is where your computer sends all of its traffic to be routed onward. For detailed information about setting up ```IPv6```, refer to our guide on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). Additionally, you can verify this on Mac or Linux using the following command:
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  172.21.2.38    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:8ef0:1794:401d:6ec9%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {30.125.190.230, 86.199.130.110}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr ea:46:0b:87:96:ab
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 66:84:39:c4:85:e2
}</pre>




## Fixing Connectivity Issues for Wired and Wireless Networks
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be utilizing a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Mac Operating Systems
Regardless of the version of OSX/macOS you are using, whether it's ```10.12.8```, ```11.4.2```, or ```12.2.9```, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a set of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes essential, particularly for teams that are embracing remote work and operating from anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
One incredibly useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although many of them are only relevant to wireless at a specific point in time, much like wdutil.

To run it in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```. Be cautious of the file sizes, which are approximately 300MB or more.
