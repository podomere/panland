## Understanding Internet Address Structure

When using the Internet, you may be assigned a Public IPv4 address, such as ```208.190.111.163```, or an IPv6 address, such as ```2000:dd9f:be77:56db:90b:845:74aa:5b```. This information can be verified at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying these addresses to non-technical individuals, or even mentioning MAC addresses like ```24:9d:3e:47:0b:7d```, can lead to errors and complexity. Moreover, it does not provide historical data, especially regarding past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web
When accessing a website, such as https://kuhn.com, your computer initially connects to a DNS server to convert the host part (kuhn) combined with the Top Level Domain (com) of the URL into an IP address, like ```43.239.104.104```. With each web request, your computer and browser also transmit their type, for example, 
`Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; AOL 9.7; AOLBuild 4343.19; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; FunWebProducts)`.
## Understanding the Significance of Default Gateways
The default gateway is usually an address automatically assigned through DHCP. Examples include ```172.21.56.163``` (often ending in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size) to which your computer forwards all traffic. For ```IPv6```, detailed guidance is available at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), but for Mac or Linux, verification can be done using:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  172.21.56.163    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:c902:a3a2:939:373e%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {125.31.51.241, 117.18.215.127}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 24:9d:3e:47:0b:7d
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 13:f0:54:db:80:3c
}</pre>




## Dealing with Wired and Wireless Issues
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
No matter which version of OSX/macOS you are currently using - whether it's ```10.15.6```, ```11.2.1```, or ```12.0.1``` - there are various tools available for troubleshooting issues. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes especially valuable, particularly for teams that embrace remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
An incredibly helpful tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only relevant at a specific point in time in relation to wireless, similar to wdutil.

To run ```sysdiagnose``` in the background and have it write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. On the other hand, if you prefer to run it *interactively*, use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` - although it will prompt a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G to locate the path. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
