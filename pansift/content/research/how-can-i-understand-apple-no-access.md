## Functioning of Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you may be assigned a Public IPv4 address such as ```89.190.67.203``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:139f:5652:2f0b:3e53:7210:20b7:1197```. These addresses can be verified at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, for those who are not technologically inclined, communicating these addresses or MAC addresses like ```ae:c7:71:ac:27:c2``` can be prone to errors and can quickly become complex. Moreover, this approach does not provide historical data, especially regarding past issues.
## Navigating the Internet

When attempting to access a website such as https://nolan.net, the initial step is to contact a DNS server to convert the host portion (nolan) in combination with the Top Level Domain (net) of the URL into an IP address, such as ```225.240.42.177```. Your computer and browser identify themselves with specific details in all web requests, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win 9x 4.90; SG; rv:1.9.2.4) Gecko/20101104 Netscape/9.1.0285```
## Significance of Default Gateways

Usually, your default gateway is an address that is automatically configured through DHCP. This gateway, such as ```10.85.93.65```, (typically ending in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size), is the point to which your computer directs all its traffic to be routed further. For ```IPv6```, a more detailed examination can be found at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), but you can verify on Mac or Linux using: <br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  10.85.93.65    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:f6dc:dda5:db46:8c59%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {231.144.210.213, 149.38.11.109}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr ae:c7:71:ac:27:c2
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 9d:e5:5e:31:45:46
}</pre>




## Tips for Resolving Wired and Wireless Connectivity Issues

When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be using a wired connection or a wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Steps for Apple macOS / OSX Users

Regardless of which version of OSX/macOS you have - whether it's 10.11.8, 11.4.8, or 12.1.3 - there are various troubleshooting tools at your disposal. However, manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes invaluable, especially for teams that have embraced remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Utilizing In-Built Scripts for Assistance

One incredibly useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of the current wireless related settings to the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Furthermore, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only relevant at a specific point in time in relation to wireless, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can execute ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` which will prompt a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
