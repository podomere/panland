      Pansift is continuously monitoring and reporting a whole suite of metrics relating to the network and health of the user's laptop. This <strong>in-path</strong> monitoring is the only true way to understand what the user is experiencing and what the network conditions are really like. <br><br><strong>Note:</strong> PanSift even watches the radio airspace and can suggest better channels to use to solve all manner of problems with video conferencing, gaming, and voice calls.
