## Understanding Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address, such as ```13.45.47.100```, or an IPv6 address, such as ```2000:296f:7959:e0ae:d059:a569:ba1a:d104```. You can verify your address at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, explaining and communicating these addresses, as well as MAC addresses like ```bf:8a:d8:24:e4:46```, can become complex, especially for those not well-versed in technology. Moreover, this method does not provide any historical data, particularly when dealing with previous issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web
When accessing a website, such as https://klein-mayert.org, your computer first contacts a DNS server to convert the host portion (klein-mayert) along with the Top Level Domain (org) of the URL into an IP address, like ```230.72.158.124```. Furthermore, your computer and browser transmit their specifications with every web request, for example: <br>```Opera/9.80 (X11; Linux i686; Ubuntu/14.10) Presto/2.12.388 Version/12.16```
## The Significance of Default Gateways
Your default gateway is typically an address that is automatically configured via DHCP and is often assigned a number ending in .1 or .254, depending on the scope size, such as ```10.130.125.171```. This is the location where your computer directs all of its traffic for routing. To learn more about ```IPv6``` connectivity, you can find a comprehensive guide at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). Additionally, on Mac or Linux systems, you can verify default gateways with the following commands:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  10.130.125.171    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:a68:757f:e758:f5a0%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {101.22.25.9, 231.38.222.36}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr bf:8a:d8:24:e4:46
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 95:c9:df:cf:7a:55
}</pre>




## Troubleshooting Connectivity Issues
When it comes to sending data to your router, you may be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Techniques for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of whether you are running ```10.11.5```, ```11.0.8```, or ```12.1.1```, there are various tools available for troubleshooting on OSX/macOS. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, especially for teams that practice remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts 
A very useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool offers a more comprehensive option to generate a wide range of logs, although many are only point-in-time related to wireless, similar to wdutil.

To run sysdiagnose in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, you can use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` and it will give a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` or use Finder with Cmd+Shift+G to point Finder to the path. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
