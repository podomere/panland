## Understanding Internet Addressing

When connecting to the Internet, you are assigned a unique identifier, such as the Public IPv4 address ```88.46.129.111``` or the IPv6 address ```2000:9688:25e6:1900:cfa2:96ae:6a6:91f6```. These addresses can be verified at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, the process of communicating these addresses and MAC addresses such as ```6c:a9:a5:b4:73:47``` can be error-prone and complex, especially for those who are not tech-savvy. Furthermore, there is often a lack of historical data regarding past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web
When accessing a website, such as https://weber-schiller.info, the initial step involves querying a DNS server to translate the domain name (weber-schiller) and the Top Level Domain (info) into an IP address, such as ```159.194.48.187```. The web requests from your computer and browser also include information about their type, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_3) AppleWebKit/537.75.14 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/7.0.3 Safari/7046A194A```
## Significance of Default Gateways
The default gateway is typically assigned through DHCP and is usually an automatically configured address, such as ```192.0.0.18``` (commonly ending in .1 or .254 based on the scope size). This gateway serves as the central point through which your computer forwards all its outgoing traffic. For ```IPv6```, detailed information on troubleshooting can be found at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). Additionally, on Mac or Linux systems, the default gateway can be verified using the following command.
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.18    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:e9b:2c4a:c69c:71a8%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {182.236.67.25, 29.156.37.159}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 6c:a9:a5:b4:73:47
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr c5:5d:4d:ff:a2:0c
}</pre>




## Resolving Issues with Wired or Wireless Connections
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you could be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX Users
Regardless of whether you are running OSX/macOS version ```10.13.5```, ```11.2.3```, or ```12.1.3```, there are various troubleshooting tools available. Unfortunately, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a set of interconnected values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes invaluable, especially for teams that have embraced remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Utilities
One extremely helpful tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs in a more comprehensive manner. However, many of these logs are only relevant to the wireless connection, similar to wdutil.

To run ```sysdiagnose``` in the background and have the logs written to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, you can use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```. Keep in mind that the file sizes can be around 300MB.
