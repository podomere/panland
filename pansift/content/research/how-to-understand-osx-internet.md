## Understanding Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address or an IPv6 address. These addresses can be verified using the tool available at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, sharing these addresses, and even MAC addresses, with non-technical individuals can be prone to errors and can become complex. Furthermore, these addresses do not provide any historical data, especially for past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

To access a website such as https://lindgren.org, your computer must initially contact a DNS server to translate the domain and top-level domain of the URL into an IP address. When accessing web pages, your computer and browser send its type with each request, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; AOL 9.7; AOLBuild 4343.19; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; FunWebProducts)```
## The Significance of Default Gateways

Normally, your default gateway address is automatically configured via DHCP. This address, such as ```192.0.0.60```, acts as the central hub for routing all traffic from your computer. For troubleshooting IPv6 connectivity on Mac or Linux, refer to [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/).
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.60    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:28e4:ca0:4094:b53a%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {176.220.10.176, 47.117.35.253}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 9d:ca:46:64:13:c4
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 86:d1:1a:f7:4b:d4
}</pre>




## Resolving Connectivity Issues: Wired vs. Wireless Networks

When it comes to transmitting data, the choice between using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium for connectivity can have a significant impact on troubleshooting strategies.
### Tips for Resolving Connectivity Problems on Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of your version of OSX/macOS, whether it's ```10.14.4```, ```11.3.7```, or ```12.0.8```, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these tools often fail to provide a series of correlated values over time, making it challenging for remote teams that embrace Work From Anywhere (WFA) to efficiently diagnose and fix connectivity issues.
#### Leveraging Pre-Installed Scripts for Troubleshooting
One valuable built-in tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a detailed snapshot of current wireless settings in the Command Line Interface (CLI) and can generate specific logs for troubleshooting purposes. For a more comprehensive approach, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be utilized to generate a wide range of logs, albeit with many being only point-in-time references for wireless connectivity, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will produce logs stored in ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```. Alternatively, you can run ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` interactively, which will display a privacy warning and prompt for the file location. However, be mindful of the large file sizes, typically around 300MB.
