00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.284
Welcome to PanSift. This is the dashboard. No

2
00:00:02.284 --> 00:00:04.466
matter where you are located or who you are

3
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:07.055
supporting remotely, you can see real time insights

4
00:00:07.055 --> 00:00:09.491
into their computer's Internet connection, their

5
00:00:09.491 --> 00:00:12.130
local Wi-Fi, and other key metrics that affect their

6
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.465
voice and video connectivity or laptop health.

7
00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:16.902
Let's take a look at the most

8
00:00:16.902 --> 00:00:18.443
recent Internet outages.

9
00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.431
By clicking on the insight we are immediately taken

10
00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:25.714
to the issue. Let's zoom in a little and

11
00:00:25.714 --> 00:00:27.655
see what's going on on "laptop 3".

12
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.651
We can see it's not specifically the Internet, as

13
00:00:30.651 --> 00:00:32.298
there was a problem reaching

14
00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:33.592
the local network too.

15
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.859
Here we can see IPv6 and IPv4 failing locally.

16
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.883
We have fast access to the previous

17
00:00:41.883 --> 00:00:43.331
public IP addresses.

18
00:00:43.403 --> 00:00:45.694
But we also notice that ARP was failing

19
00:00:45.694 --> 00:00:47.162
to complete at times too.

20
00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:50.399
With built-in lookups we can also see the vendor's

21
00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.750
organizationally unique identifier to

22
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.975
help with equipment identification.

23
00:00:55.102 --> 00:00:57.390
We can also see the interfaces used by the

24
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.678
default route including the hardware type.

25
00:00:59.732 --> 00:01:02.545
And we can also see the local interface

26
00:01:02.545 --> 00:01:04.853
IPs used during this time range.

27
00:01:04.925 --> 00:01:07.477
At all times, the host details are available

28
00:01:07.477 --> 00:01:09.100
to us on the left hand side.

29
00:01:13.045 --> 00:01:17.001
We can also see the test hosts used for DNS, trace

30
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:20.482
rowts, and basic HTTP tests. These hosts are

31
00:01:20.482 --> 00:01:22.855
editable on the paid plan with

32
00:01:22.855 --> 00:01:24.912
up to 5 arbitrary records.

33
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.120
Now let's take a peak at DNS. We actively query the

34
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.033
DNS servers for the test host records, but also do

35
00:01:31.033 --> 00:01:33.945
additional random queries to force full resolution

36
00:01:33.945 --> 00:01:36.159
rather than relying on cached records.

37
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.487
Let's add 30 minutes to either side, to

38
00:01:39.487 --> 00:01:42.144
get a better picture of response times.

39
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.494
Now let's see where in the world this agent's IP

40
00:01:45.494 --> 00:01:48.291
addresses are coming from during this time period.

41
00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:50.640
Our lighthouses reflect back the public IP

42
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.493
addresses, as seen from the agent requests. We give

43
00:01:53.493 --> 00:01:57.353
city level resolution and depending on the ISP's attention to detail,

44
00:01:57.353 --> 00:01:58.863
we can get pretty specific.

45
00:01:59.143 --> 00:02:02.931
In the trace and ASN section, we show, not just the

46
00:02:02.931 --> 00:02:06.496
hops, but also generate real time, ASNÂ  lookups,

47
00:02:06.496 --> 00:02:11.399
and also include the AS names. You can spot changes in hop length,

48
00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:13.702
and autonomous system, rapidly.

49
00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:16.866
These paths are available historically for all your

50
00:02:16.866 --> 00:02:19.403
configured test hosts, which includes either

51
00:02:19.403 --> 00:02:21.652
IP or ASN paths for easy cut and paste.

52
00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:24.602
Similarly we can see status codes

53
00:02:24.602 --> 00:02:27.094
and baseline speeds for HTTP.

54
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.079
PanSift's agents also allow the missing link, which

55
00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:32.864
is, for a user to add custom notes giving missing

56
00:02:32.864 --> 00:02:35.593
context, during an issue or outage. Even if they

57
00:02:35.593 --> 00:02:38.038
are offline, all notes and measurements are

58
00:02:38.038 --> 00:02:40.141
buffered until the agent syncs again,

59
00:02:40.141 --> 00:02:41.960
via a local network, or hotspot.

60
00:02:42.244 --> 00:02:45.324
Notice that each tab change preserves the current

61
00:02:45.324 --> 00:02:48.405
time window, but if you want to be more specific,

62
00:02:48.405 --> 00:02:51.233
you can specify exact query times quickly and

63
00:02:51.233 --> 00:02:54.377
easily. Additionally, you can even share URL links

64
00:02:54.377 --> 00:02:56.200
with those you invite to view

65
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.897
or administer your account.

66
00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:00.544
With the explosion in Wi-Fi devices, it's

67
00:03:00.544 --> 00:03:03.162
imperative to understand airtime and channels,

68
00:03:03.162 --> 00:03:05.950
especially in dense environments. Pansift watches

69
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.454
out for weak MCS values and color codes them

70
00:03:08.454 --> 00:03:10.446
showing you when bad signal quality

71
00:03:10.446 --> 00:03:12.267
is causing issues or slow downs.

72
00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:15.036
PanSift is also scanning your local Wi-Fi

73
00:03:15.036 --> 00:03:17.945
environment and records other networks including

74
00:03:17.945 --> 00:03:20.976
what channels, widths, and vendors they are using.

75
00:03:20.976 --> 00:03:24.006
This means you can tell what parts of the airspace

76
00:03:24.006 --> 00:03:26.915
are contended and what RF space is free. Pansift

77
00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:30.006
will even suggest alternate channels for you to use

78
00:03:30.006 --> 00:03:32.673
based upon device supported channels and the

79
00:03:32.673 --> 00:03:35.098
used channels in the current time frame.

80
00:03:35.522 --> 00:03:37.857
So, you can rapidly and instantaneously

81
00:03:37.857 --> 00:03:40.612
troubleshoot Wi-Fi, IP, interfaces, status and

82
00:03:40.612 --> 00:03:43.366
more, but without having to try and access the

83
00:03:43.366 --> 00:03:45.701
terminal on a remote machine or annoy a

84
00:03:45.701 --> 00:03:47.917
non-technical user. You can see in to

85
00:03:47.917 --> 00:03:49.893
the past right up to the present.

86
00:03:50.192 --> 00:03:53.375
The agent section lets you go direct to any agent

87
00:03:53.375 --> 00:03:56.688
to deep dive when need be. In the background , data

88
00:03:56.688 --> 00:03:59.936
is stored in buckets, and there's a handy guide to

89
00:03:59.936 --> 00:04:03.249
walk you through onboarding agents. From the remote

90
00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:05.978
user perspective an agent install is hands

91
00:04:05.978 --> 00:04:08.056
off and zero touch provisioning.

92
00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:11.055
Well done, you've now got the power to save time,

93
00:04:11.055 --> 00:04:13.456
trouble, and toil while supporting work from

94
00:04:13.456 --> 00:04:16.131
anywhere. Gain the confidence to provide fearless

95
00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:18.477
support! Step through the guide if you need

96
00:04:18.477 --> 00:04:20.769
help and remember to instrument your edge!

97
00:04:20.988 --> 00:04:23.733
Now, try out the one click demo yourself and

98
00:04:23.733 --> 00:04:26.478
install some of the free agents on a problem

99
00:04:26.478 --> 00:04:28.538
machine or in a problem location.
