## Understanding Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you may have a Public IPv4 address such as ```119.112.50.167``` or even an IPv6 address like ```2000:24e7:e3c5:21c8:9f2e:8c0e:648f:bd74```. If you want to verify this information, you can do so by visiting [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, attempting to convey these addresses to individuals who are not well-versed in technology can be mistake-prone and quickly become complex. Moreover, this method does not provide any historical data, particularly for previous issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web
When trying to access a web page, like for example, https://ortiz.org, your first step is to reach out to a DNS server. This server will translate the host portion (ortiz) in combination with the Top Level Domain (org) of the URL into an IP address, such as ```103.153.23.39```. Interestingly, your computer and browser communicate their type with every web request, for example, ```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; AS; rv:11.0) like Gecko```
## The Significance of Default Gateways
Usually, your default gateway is an automatically assigned address through DHCP. You will be given a default gateway, such as ```192.0.0.249``` (although they normally end in .1 or .254, depending on the scope size). This is the point where your computer sends all of its traffic to be routed onwards. If you are using ```IPv6```, you can refer to our comprehensive guide on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). Alternatively, you can verify this information on Mac or Linux by using the following commands:
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.249    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:7524:efe9:6971:2b22%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {94.189.197.174, 74.108.86.121}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 83:d2:71:34:86:cb
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr cc:92:7a:94:b2:43
}</pre>




## Resolving Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be utilizing a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting on Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of the version of OSX/macOS you are using, whether it's ```10.15.4```, ```11.5.4```, or ```12.2.1```, there are various troubleshooting tools available. Unfortunately, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a set of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting proves to be beneficial, especially for teams that are adapting to remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
One valuable tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is point-in-time data specifically related to wireless, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```. If you prefer to run it *interactively*, you can use ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` and it will display a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
