# Elevator Pitch
Data networks are crucial but never so much so as with the mass migration to Working From Anywhere. Our residential ISPs and local networks now faciliate what our employers office networks used to. But how do you support technical and network issues with a distributed and flexible workforce? It's not easy to do a desk visit. How much time does one flaky location or user with intermittent issues cost you? Is it the ISP, the Wi-Fi, the local network, the router, or the laptop?

PanSift helps tech teams to support Work From Anywhere (WFA). PanSift is all about using real user experience monitoring and then digging in to that data to tell the story of what's going on to fix any issues. It empowers tech teams to do instant and easy troubleshooting to resolve user's issues (especially the opaque network related ones). Reducing toil and a team's Time to Resolution for support issues makes everyone happy, more productive, and frees up staff to focus on more strategic challenges.

# Who / Background
Donal has been working in IT, networks, and security for the last 20 years and after spending time in multinational vendors, telecommunications companies, and hypergrowth startups, he then went on to start a few small businesses fitting out conferences and large coworking spaces with wireless first IT services. During this time he identified the need for better troubleshooting tools for users, vendors, opertors, and service providers. After a few detours in to building his own remote HR technical testing tool, and some security deception technology, he returned to the seemingly simple but incredibly complex challenge of providing troubleshooting tools for the accelerating remote workforce. 

Insights from providing wireless to events and large coworking spaces mean that spaces do not contain employees and users from one distinct organization or company. They are a hodge podge of different entities from freelancers and contractors,  to startups and teams from larger organizations, who all see their digital connections and tools as critical infrastructure. Not all home offices or coworking spaces manage to provide the optimal networks or digital user experiences. Oftentimes these crucial footprints lay unmanaged with no proactive monitoring, or the expertise is unavailable to diagnose and troubleshoot issues from the user's perspective. It gets even more difficult when trying to diagnose historical or intermittent issues, and harder still when supporting non-technical users.

This is how PanSift was born. Pansift is not just a tool for tech teams with basic remote workers but also for organization's with contact centres, sales, or customer success teams working remotely. These teams use many realtime communication applications that necessitate superior connectivity no matter the location, to ensure voice and video quality. 

Cloud base Software-as-a-Service is exactly that, it depends wholly on multiple networks below it performing optimally, not just healthy endpoints, to function.

# What It Does
PanSift installs as a lightweight agent on a Mac laptop (Windows/Linux to come) and watches the wireless airspace and connectivity while continually performing a suite of tests to the local network and beyond. This data is then frequently uploaded to the PanSift cloud and any designated entity can then rapidly troubleshoot issues from anywhere. PanSift even makes suggestions for better configuration like Wi-Fi channels and you can customize test endpoints like webpages, DNS records, and traceroutes.

Even if there is a total outage from the ISP, local network, or Wi-Fi edge, PanSift uploads once reconnected or when a user switches to mobile data. This means that a remote technical support team can see exactly what happened, when, and dig in to historical configuration and monitoring, no matter where or when the user is experiencing issues.

# What It Can Do In The Future
With a growing support for different Operating Systems and test tools, PanSift will become the single easiest troubleshooting tool to use, especially for remote work.

Once aggregate data sets are available, anonymized, and normalized, there's a lot that PanSift can then answer on a wider scale. There are also lots of AI (Artificial Intelligence) opportunties for clustering, pattern matching, troubleshooting, and prediction with (WFA) Work From Anywhere data.
