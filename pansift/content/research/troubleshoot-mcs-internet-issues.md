## Understanding Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address such as ```172.208.146.139``` or an IPv6 address such as ```2000:91b9:3b5:efc2:c75d:a107:90db:aaa1```. To check your address, visit [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, explaining these addresses or MAC addresses like ```ae:4a:47:14:d3:c2``` to non-technical individuals can be prone to errors and becomes complex. It also lacks historical data, especially for past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web
When accessing a website like https://trantow.org, your computer initially contacts a DNS server to convert the host portion (trantow) and the Top Level Domain (org) of the URL into an IP address like ```0.111.81.47```. Your computer and browser also send its type with each web request, for example: <br> ```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT x.y; Win64; x64; rv:10.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0```
## The Significance of Default Gateways
Your default gateway is usually automatically configured through DHCP and is represented by an address such as ```192.168.67.231``` (although they typically end in .1 or .254 based on the scope size). This is where your computer directs all its traffic to be routed. For ```IPv6```, you can obtain more information in the blog [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/) and you can check on Mac or Linux by using: 
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.168.67.231    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:20cd:3c5e:7507:7880%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {146.192.7.199, 34.108.73.58}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr ae:4a:47:14:d3:c2
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr cf:53:f7:eb:cb:e8
}</pre>




## Resolving Connectivity Issues for Wired and Wireless Networks

When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you might be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layers.
### Troubleshooting Steps for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of the version of OSX/macOS you are using, whether it's ```10.14.4```, ```11.2.1```, or ```12.3.5```, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a set of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes invaluable, especially for teams that embrace remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Utilizing Native Scripts for Assistance
A useful tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of the current wireless settings in CLI and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. In addition, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only related to wireless at a specific point in time, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will write the logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```. Alternatively, you can run it interactively by using ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` and navigate to the correct location in Finder or through the path ```/var/tmp``` with Cmd+Shift+G in Finder. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
