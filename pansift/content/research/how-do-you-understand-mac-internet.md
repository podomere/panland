## Understanding Internet Addressing

When connecting to the internet, you are assigned a unique public IPv4 or IPv6 address, such as ```232.20.98.18``` or ```2000:b090:ab2:2bbf:b666:6ae3:344c:293b```. Ensure your address is accurate by checking on [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). For those unfamiliar with technical details, conveying these addresses, including MAC addresses like ```1c:1f:03:82:63:f0```, can be complicated and prone to errors, especially without access to historical data.
## Navigating the World Wide Web
When accessing a webpage like https://macejkovic-kerluke.info, your computer communicates with a DNS server to translate the host portion (macejkovic-kerluke) combined with the Top Level Domain (info) to an IP address like ```36.229.137.46```. Additionally, your computer and browser send its type with every web request, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win 9x 4.90; SG; rv:1.9.2.4) Gecko/20101104 Netscape/9.1.0285```
## Significance of Default Gateways
Your default gateway is typically an automatically configured address via DHCP, such as ```172.17.41.102```, where your computer sends all its traffic to be routed onwards. For ```IPv6```, detailed information on how to check on Mac or Linux is available at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/).
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  172.17.41.102    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:ec9f:f9d9:1910:f2c8%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {119.121.174.208, 88.221.41.127}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 1c:1f:03:82:63:f0
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 43:82:3a:6d:39:25
}</pre>




## Resolve Issues with Wired or Wireless Connections
Whether you are using a physical wired connection or a wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the data layer to transmit data to your router, troubleshooting can help resolve any issues.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX Users
No matter which version of OSX/macOS you are currently using, whether it's ```10.15.8```, ```11.3.9```, or ```12.0.7```, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting comes into play, particularly for teams that are embracing remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Tools for Troubleshooting
One useful tool for OSX/macOS users is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific troubleshooting logs. Another comprehensive tool is the ```sysdiagnose``` tool, which can generate a wide range of logs, although much of it pertains to wireless settings only, similar to wdutil.

To run the ```sysdiagnose``` tool in the background and generate logs in ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, you can use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, although it will display a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it will open Finder in the correct location for you to access the logs, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
