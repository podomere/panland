## The Functioning of Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, individuals may be assigned a Public IPv4 address, such as ```87.71.36.20```, or an IPv6 address, like ```2000:d4d4:185d:a4af:63fd:b231:965e:cdd3```. This information can be verified at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, for those unfamiliar with technical terminology, conveying these addresses, or even referencing MAC addresses like ```4a:cd:a7:18:4e:f7```, can be prone to errors and becomes complex. Additionally, it does not provide any historical data, particularly regarding past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

When attempting to visit a web page, such as https://orn.net, an initial step involves accessing a DNS server to translate the host portion (orn) combined with the Top Level Domain (net) of the URL to an IP address, like ```92.198.122.220```. Additionally, the computer and browser transmit their types with all web requests, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_3) AppleWebKit/537.75.14 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/7.0.3 Safari/7046A194A```
## Understanding the Significance of Default Gateways

Typically, a default gateway is an automatically configured address received via DHCP. This default gateway, such as ```10.78.15.152``` (commonly ending in .1 or .254 based on the scope size), is where a computer sends all traffic to be routed onwards. For ```IPv6```, comprehensive information is available in the article [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/). Users can also verify this information on Mac or Linux using:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  10.78.15.152    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:ff22:8e26:73c0:9951%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {178.33.123.237, 39.109.61.210}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 4a:cd:a7:18:4e:f7
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 7f:60:6a:1a:bb:ca
}</pre>




## Solutions for Wired and Wireless Connectivity Issues
When transmitting data to your router, you may encounter connectivity issues at the physical and data layer, whether you are using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium.
### Tips for Troubleshooting on Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of the version of OSX/macOS you are using, whether it's ```10.15.9```, ```11.1.5```, or ```12.1.5```, there are several troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes invaluable, particularly for teams that embrace remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
A useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI, and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a variety of logs, although much of it is only related to wireless settings at a particular point in time, similar to wdutil.

To run ```sysdiagnose``` in the background and generate logs in ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, you can use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will give a privacy warning. When running it in the foreground, it will open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` or use Finder with Cmd+Shift+G to specify the path. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
