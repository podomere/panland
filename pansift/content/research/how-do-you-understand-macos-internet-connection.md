## Understanding Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned an IP address, such as ```176.28.160.189``` for IPv4 or ```2000:8408:c20a:fa4f:90e0:baf7:2dbf:5048``` for IPv6. You can verify this information by visiting [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying these addresses and MAC addresses like ```0f:4a:dc:de:ea:2b``` to those not well-versed in technology can be prone to error and quickly become complex. Furthermore, this information does not provide any historical data, especially regarding past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web
When accessing a website such as https://goldner.net, your initial contact is with a DNS server to translate the host portion (goldner) and the Top Level Domain (net) of the URL into an IP address such as ```161.45.86.72```. Your computer and browser send this type of information with all web requests, such as <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; AOL 9.7; AOLBuild 4343.19; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; FunWebProducts)```.
## The Significance of Default Gateways
Your default gateway is typically an automatically configured address through DHCP, such as ```10.2.58.241``` (although they usually end in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size). This is where your computer sends all its traffic to be routed onwards. For ```IPv6```, we offer an in-depth discussion on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), but you can also check on Mac or Linux with: <br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  10.2.58.241    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:7e1d:694e:939e:eeec%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {83.212.84.233, 169.138.173.170}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 0f:4a:dc:de:ea:2b
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 60:46:15:6f:a1:ad
}</pre>




## Solutions for Diagnosing and Resolving Connectivity Issues

Whether you are using a physical Ethernet connection or a wireless (Wi-Fi) medium to transmit data to your router, troubleshooting may be necessary to address any connectivity issues.
### Tips for Managing Connectivity on Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of your version of OSX/macOS, whether it's ```10.11.9```, ```11.2.3```, or ```12.1.3```, there are various tools available for diagnosing and resolving connectivity issues. However, these manual actions and scripts may not provide a comprehensive set of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, especially for teams that embrace remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Utilizing Built-in Scripts for Assistance
One useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a detailed overview of current wireless settings through the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the more comprehensive ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of the information is only relevant to wireless issues, similar to wdutil.

To run ```sysdiagnose``` in the background and generate logs in ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. Alternatively, running it interactively will prompt a privacy warning, and the logs will be written to the specified directory. Be mindful of the file sizes, which can be around 300MB.
