## Understanding Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address, such as ```225.162.11.82```, or an IPv6 address, like ```2000:e38f:5438:9272:e0d5:ba4f:6c25:5a9f```. You can verify this by visiting [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying these addresses to individuals who are not technically inclined, or even sharing MAC addresses such as ```f2:e6:92:1c:5d:2b```, can be prone to error and become complex. Moreover, this approach lacks historical data, particularly in the context of past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

In order to access a website like https://hilpert-weimann.net, you begin by contacting a DNS server to convert the host portion (hilpert-weimann) along with the Top Level Domain (net) of the URL into an IP address, such as ```152.147.175.129```. Whenever your computer and browser make web requests, they include information about their type, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win 9x 4.90; SG; rv:1.9.2.4) Gecko/20101104 Netscape/9.1.0285```
## Significance of Default Gateways

The default gateway is typically an automatically assigned address through DHCP. It may be a default gateway like ```10.138.203.63``` (though they generally end in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size), and this is where your computer sends all its traffic to be routed onwards. For ```IPv6```, there is a detailed overview available at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), and users can verify this on Mac or Linux by using the following command:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  10.138.203.63    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:2874:29a5:fd48:ba6%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {159.180.119.195, 123.116.210.213}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr f2:e6:92:1c:5d:2b
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr fb:58:d6:b7:6c:ab
}</pre>




## Solutions for Wired and Wireless Connectivity Issues
When it comes to sending data to your router, you may encounter connectivity issues at the physical and data layer, whether you are using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium.
### Troubleshooting on Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of the version of OSX/macOS you are using, whether it's ```10.15.5```, ```11.1.9```, or ```12.0.4```, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes invaluable, particularly for teams operating remotely or embracing a Work From Anywhere (WFA) model.
#### Use of Built-in Scripts
A useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting purposes. Furthermore, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool offers a more comprehensive range of logs, although many are point-in-time only in relation to wireless, similar to wdutil.

To run the ```sysdiagnose``` tool in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, you can use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` which will display a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
