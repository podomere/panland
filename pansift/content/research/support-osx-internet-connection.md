## The Functioning of Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, individuals may be assigned a Public IPv4 address such as ```124.213.226.58``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:fae3:f107:54d7:8109:2cdb:c2ac:277c```. It is possible to verify this information by visiting [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, attempting to relay these addresses to individuals who are not technologically savvy, even mentioning MAC addresses like ```f4:e8:63:a0:0a:bf```, can be prone to error and become complex quickly. Moreover, this method does not provide historical data, notably when past issues arise.
## Navigating the Internet
In the process of accessing a webpage like https://muller.info, the initial step involves connecting to a DNS server to convert the host portion (muller) and the Top Level Domain (info) of the URL into an IP address such as ```131.6.35.89```. In fact, every web request originating from your computer and browser includes its type, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_3) AppleWebKit/537.75.14 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/7.0.3 Safari/7046A194A```
## Significance of Default Gateways
Typically, the default gateway is an address configured automatically through DHCP. A default gateway, such as ```192.168.178.63``` (usually ending in .1 or .254 based on the size of the scope), is where your computer dispatches all its traffic to be routed further. For ```IPv6```, an in-depth explanation is available at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), while it can be verified on Mac or Linux using: <br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.168.178.63    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:f77f:7ff:91ec:92bf%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {130.104.172.133, 213.5.70.87}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr f4:e8:63:a0:0a:bf
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 5f:b6:c6:45:99:1d
}</pre>




## Resolving Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you might be using either a wired or a wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple's macOS / OSX
Regardless of the version of OSX/macOS you're using, whether it's ```10.14.4```, ```11.3.9```, or ```12.1.7```, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a set of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes invaluable, particularly for teams that have embraced remote work and the Work From Anywhere (WFA) concept.
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
One useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to produce a wide range of logs, although much of it is only relevant to wireless settings, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will generate logs in ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz``` for you. If you prefer to run it *interactively* (although there isn't much interaction), you can execute the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will prompt a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. It's important to be aware of the file sizes, which are typically around 300MB.
