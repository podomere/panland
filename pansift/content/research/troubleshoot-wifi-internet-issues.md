## Understanding Internet Protocol Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address such as ```97.134.69.254``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:534d:ed4e:643f:7e22:ed30:5231:4d1e```. This information can be verified at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, conveying these addresses to non-technical individuals or referencing MAC addresses like ```ca:b8:c8:ea:33:aa``` can lead to errors and complexity, with no inclusion of historical data.
## Navigating Websites
When accessing a website such as https://hand.io, the first step is to contact a DNS server to convert the host portion (hand) combined with the Top Level Domain (io) of the URL to an IP address like ```224.196.25.202```. Furthermore, all web requests from your computer and browser include your type, such as <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; AOL 9.7; AOLBuild 4343.19; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; FunWebProducts)```
## Significance of Default Gateways
The default gateway, typically obtained through DHCP, is an automatically configured address like ```192.0.0.5``` (often ending in .1 or .254 based on scope size). This is where your computer forwards all its traffic for routing onward. For ```IPv6```, a comprehensive guide can be found at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), and verification can be done on Mac or Linux with: <br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.5    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:15c3:981c:cb5c:2d28%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {59.89.100.119, 15.234.155.252}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr ca:b8:c8:ea:33:aa
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 50:bb:46:b1:56:a3
}</pre>




## Resolve Issues with Wired and Wireless Connectivity
When sending data to your router, it's important to troubleshoot any issues that may arise at the physical and data layer, whether using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium.
### Tips for Troubleshooting on Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of the version of OSX/macOS you are using, whether it's ```10.13.4```, ```11.6.5```, or ```12.3.4```, there are a variety of troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes particularly useful, especially for teams that are embracing remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
A helpful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although most are point-in-time only in relation to wireless, similar to wdutil.

To run ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```. For an interactive experience (although there is not much interaction), you can run ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` and it will display a privacy warning. If not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` or use Finder with Cmd+Shift+G to point Finder to the path. However, be aware of the file sizes, which are approximately 300MB.
