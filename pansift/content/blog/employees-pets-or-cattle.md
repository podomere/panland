Let's talk about culture, the hiring process, and candidate experience. Talent teams including technical recruitment and sourcing are both the scouts and gatekeepers of an organization's culture. They are high level stewards of an organisation's true operating system, its people.

Unfortunately there's a growing dichotomy between those organisations who consider their people an asset, and those who think employees are a necessary evil. In an age of increasing automation, many departments are beginning to adopt one of two associated perspectives whereby they embrace platforms or technologies that embrace "smart boxes/dumb people" or "dumb boxes/smart people".

This phrase applies to approach of what to try and commoditise and where to embed 'smart' in to the layers of organisational design. Originally the concept applied to network devices and vendors but it is equally applicable to a whole organisation's design and operation. For years there's been talk of core versus context and outsourcing versus insourcing but there's one asset (dependent upon activity) you should aspire to always have the best and most resilient of, for as long as possible, people. Their values and actions express collectively as culture, and this is your organisation's Operating System irrespective of what technology you use.

# Employee Lifetime Value (ELV)

As software is eating the world, organisations are (from a macro perspective) becoming *technology organisations* though still built and run by people. The question then arises about how you design, build, and operate your company around a continuity of people, process, and technology. 

What are you optimsing for? What are you measuring? What is your business' operating environment? What do you value most?

# Employee Lifetime Value (ELV)

If your organisation is comprised of people and your technology is designed to augment human activity (rather than outright replace it), you will still need to attract and retain the smartest people you can. Once hired it is optimal that employees stay, grow, and contribute rather than churn and incur expense to back fill positions while walking out the door with institutional knowledge. There's a difference between an employee who makes themselves dispensable by automating away their workload (to free themselves up to work on more challenging or valuable tasks) versus treating employees as commodities who can be easily interchanged. 

# Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral, Revenue

Irrespective of your hiring expertise and intent, an applicant (or candidate) already has a feeling and instinct about your brand. A feeling that's been informed by previous marketing and general market sentiment. Most importantly, their perspective has been influenced by peer and personal experiences of your brand. If an applicant is interested in working with your organization, every touchpoint from here on in shapes their sentiment exponentially. How they are treated sets the tone not just for their potential future employment with you, but if they are unsuccessful, they then become influencers in the market regarding your hiring practices and perceived culture. This is something to be painfully aware of in the age of network recruitment.

Having a structured hiring process which is communicated well from the outset moulds an applicant or candidate's expectations. A structured and non-bias process reflects a culture that thinks things through, respects its current and future workforce, and shows that it optimises for both internal and external entities. Although we're all different, a consistent and repeatable process which minimizes bias is something which can scale. When operating from a framework some customization is possible yet a 100% bespoke process (each time) is sloppy, inefficient, and a very bad signal.

# Structured Hiring and Applicant Testing

## Pre hire Assessment Tests (Measuring Skills)
When a technical recruiter, sourcer or hiring manager is trying to verify claimed skills it can be helpful to have applicants perform some form of task to demonstrate their technical competency. Unrelated to a psychometric or personality assessment (or any other behavioural assessment) a job aptitude test can provide at least some data points that either support or refute a CV or résumé.

Advanced technical recruitment teams are increasingly using a *skills* verification test. These tests are sometimes referred to as a skills test, job assessment, or take home test. They are different from general aptitude tests in that they actually attempt to have an applicant or candidate show distinct capabilities in relation to a role's more narrow set of skills (as per an individual job description).

For information technology jobs and related engineering careers, the hiring process is increasingly including an online aptitude test (and/or competency based interview questions) as a way to independently verify job skills (a form of 'human' test driven development for organisational software if you will). Fundamentally [CVs are broken and biased](https://pansift.com/blog/why-cvs-and-resumes-are-broken/), but even more so in today's unregulated and fast moving I.T. industry. Independent verification is crucial in the latest recruitment for engineers.
