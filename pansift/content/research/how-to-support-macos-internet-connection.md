## Understanding Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned a unique Public IPv4 or IPv6 address. You can check your IP address at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/), but communicating and managing these addresses can be complex for non-technical users. Obtaining historical data for previous issues can also be challenging.
## Navigating the World Wide Web
Accessing a website like https://hyatt.net involves translating the website's URL to an IP address using a DNS server. Your computer and browser also share important data with each web request, such as the type and version.
## Significance of Default Gateways
The default gateway, usually assigned via DHCP, is the designated route for all outgoing traffic from your computer. This is typically an address like ```172.23.40.115```,  ending in .1 or .254 based on the network scope. For IPv6, detailed troubleshooting steps are available at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), and instructions for Mac or Linux users are provided.
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  172.23.40.115    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:3cf4:c74:af47:6582%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {208.87.169.136, 71.17.224.255}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 62:8b:fc:d7:17:ab
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 96:a4:65:d9:52:54
}</pre>




## Fixing Connection Issues for Wired and Wireless Networks

When sending data to your router, you may be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Resolving Connectivity Problems on Apple macOS / OSX
Irrespective of the version of OSX/macOS you are using, whether it's ```10.13.6```, ```11.1.9```, or ```12.0.1```, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, the manual actions and scripts don't provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes essential, particularly for teams that adopt remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Utilizing Internal Scripts for Assistance
One useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI, and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Another comprehensive tool is the ```sysdiagnose``` tool, which can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it pertains to wireless settings just like wdutil.

To run it in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, you can use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it *interactively*, use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, but beware of the large file sizes of about 300MB.
