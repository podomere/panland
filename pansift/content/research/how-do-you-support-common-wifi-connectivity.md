## Explanation of Internet Protocol Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned an IP address, such as ```61.223.206.140``` for IPv4 or ```2000:d847:f1bb:c7a:45f0:1b3:c989:5d1a``` for IPv6. You can verify your IP address at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, explaining these addresses, as well as MAC addresses like ```1b:a5:74:29:27:5f```, to those who are not tech-savvy can lead to errors and confusion. Furthermore, this method does not provide historical data, especially when trying to resolve past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web
To access a website, such as https://runte.biz, your device connects to a DNS server to convert the URL's host portion (runte) and its Top Level Domain (biz) into an IP address, such as ```219.243.17.196```. Whenever a web request is made, your computer and browser send their specifications, such as <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_3) AppleWebKit/537.75.14 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/7.0.3 Safari/7046A194A```.
## Significance of Default Gateways
By default, your gateway is usually assigned through DHCP and may appear as ```192.168.198.142``` (typically ending in .1 or .254, depending on the scope size). This is the point to which your computer sends all outgoing traffic to be routed further. To troubleshoot ```IPv6``` connectivity on Mac or Linux, refer to our detailed guide [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/).
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.168.198.142    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:1efc:9273:1550:cbd3%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {202.131.10.121, 135.50.120.166}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 1b:a5:74:29:27:5f
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 03:85:92:7e:5a:99
}</pre>




## Resolving Issues with Wired and Wireless Connectivity
Regardless of whether you are using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) connection at the physical and data layer, it is important to troubleshoot any issues in order to ensure smooth data transmission to your router.
### Effective Measures for Apple macOS / OSX Users
Regardless of the version of OSX/macOS being used, whether it is ```10.13.9```, ```11.0.8```, or ```12.3.8```, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a comprehensive set of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes crucial, especially for remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA) teams.
#### Utilizing Pre-Installed Scripts
An incredibly useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific troubleshooting logs. Furthermore, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although many are only relevant to wireless settings, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```. If you prefer to run it *interactively* (despite minimal interaction), you can run<br>```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` which will prompt a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` or use Finder with Cmd+Shift+G to locate the path. However, keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
