## Understanding Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you may have a Public IPv4 address such as ```239.58.7.64``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:6d7f:e9c2:ebaa:475:e075:cee1:1155```. This information can be verified at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, for individuals who are not tech-savvy, communicating these addresses or even referencing MAC addresses like ```ab:ac:52:9f:ad:40``` can be prone to errors and become complex. Furthermore, this does not provide any historical data, especially when addressing past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

When attempting to access a web page such as https://cummings.name, the initial step involves connecting to a DNS server to convert the host portion (cummings) along with the Top Level Domain (name) of the URL into an IP address, such as ```121.192.166.181```. Your computer and browser always sends its type with every web request e.g. <br>```Opera/9.80 (X11; Linux i686; Ubuntu/14.10) Presto/2.12.388 Version/12.16```
## The Significance of Default Gateways

Typically, your default gateway is an address that is automatically configured via DHCP. This default gateway, such as ```172.20.214.46``` (although they often end in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size), is where your computer routes all of its traffic. For ```IPv6```, more detailed information can be found at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), and it can be checked on Mac or Linux using:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  172.20.214.46    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:a62a:8ee2:d002:f4b4%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {70.212.149.78, 159.90.22.114}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr ab:ac:52:9f:ad:40
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 5b:d7:d2:43:95:a5
}</pre>




## Resolving Wired and Wireless Connectivity Issues
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layers.
### Tips for Troubleshooting on Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of whether you are running OSX/macOS ```10.14.7```, ```11.5.8```, or ```12.1.2```, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes especially valuable, particularly for teams that have adopted remote work or a Work From Anywhere (WFA) policy.
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
One valuable tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific troubleshooting logs. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can generate a wide range of logs, although many of them are only point-in-time related to wireless, much like wdutil.

To run it in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it *interactively*, you can use ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, but be cautious of the file sizes, which are typically around 300MB.
