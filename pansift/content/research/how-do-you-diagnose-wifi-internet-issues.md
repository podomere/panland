## A Closer Look at Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you are likely to have a Public IPv4 address, such as ```240.169.47.220```, or an IPv6 address, like ```2000:13ef:fda:c455:8d0c:bc64:1f08:e784```. These can be verified from [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, for those who are not particularly tech-savvy, trying to communicate these addresses or even calling out MAC addresses, like ```0d:c8:26:99:12:2b```, can be prone to errors and quickly become complex. Furthermore, this method does not provide any historical data, especially when dealing with past issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

When accessing a website like https://quitzon.net, the first step is to access a DNS server to convert the host portion (quitzon) combined with the Top Level Domain (net) of the URL into an IP address, such as ```96.56.202.35```. Your computer and browser actually include its type with every web request, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2228.0 Safari/537.36```.
## Understanding the Significance of Default Gateways

Your default gateway is typically an automatically configured address via DHCP. You receive a default gateway, such as ```192.0.0.157``` (although they usually end in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size), and this is where your computer sends all its traffic to be routed onwards. For ```IPv6```, a more in-depth explanation can be found at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), but you can check on Mac or Linux using: <br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.0.0.157    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:eba2:ddca:5598:b3be%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {105.143.170.102, 182.64.167.104}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 0d:c8:26:99:12:2b
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 3c:30:15:f2:fc:0c
}</pre>




## Fixing Connectivity Issues for Wired and Wireless Networks

When it comes to sending data to your router, you may be utilizing either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Solutions for Apple macOS / OSX Users
Regardless of whether you are using OSX or macOS version ```10.13.4```, ```11.1.4```, or ```12.2.9```, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, especially for teams that practice remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Utilizing Built-in Scripts for Assistance
An extremely useful tool on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless-related settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Furthermore, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only relevant to wireless during a specific point in time, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` will execute it in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz``` for you. If you prefer to run it *interactively* (even though there is minimal interaction), you can use<br>```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will prompt a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` or use Finder with Cmd+Shift+G to locate the path. Keep in mind that the file sizes are around 300MB more or less.
