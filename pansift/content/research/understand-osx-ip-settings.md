## Understanding the Functioning of Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you might have a Public IPv4 address similar to ```216.190.32.42``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:8ad8:eaf5:cb50:6c05:7b53:2c2e:880b```. Verifying this information can be done through [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, for those who are not tech-savvy, relaying or referencing these addresses, or MAC addresses like ```91:54:c6:fe:a1:82```, can often lead to errors and become complex quickly. Moreover, this does not provide any historical data, especially from when previous issues occurred.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

In order to access a website such as https://reichel.org, you initially reach out to a DNS server to convert the host portion (reichel) combined with the Top Level Domain (org) of the URL into an IP address like ```45.108.167.205```. Your computer and browser include its type in all web requests, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win 9x 4.90; SG; rv:1.9.2.4) Gecko/20101104 Netscape/9.1.0285```
## The Significance of Default Gateways

Your default gateway is generally an address that is automatically configured via DHCP. It provides you with a default gateway like ```192.168.253.82``` (although they generally end in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size) and this is where your computer sends all its traffic to be routed onwards. For ```IPv6```, you can delve deeper into this by visiting [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/) - but on Mac or Linux, you can check using: <br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.168.253.82    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:4ef9:1f75:108d:de78%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {121.235.172.173, 36.216.45.105}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 91:54:c6:fe:a1:82
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr df:c0:b8:c2:9c:65
}</pre>




## Resolve Issues with Wired or Wireless Networks
When it comes to sending data to your router, you may be utilizing a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Steps for Apple macOS / OSX Troubleshooting
Regardless of the version of OSX/macOS you are using, whether it's ```10.15.4```, ```11.1.3```, or ```12.1.3```, there are various troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes valuable, particularly for teams that are embracing remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Utilize Built-in Scripts for Assistance
An extremely useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info``` command, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting purposes. Furthermore, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it is only relevant at a specific point in time in relation to wireless, similar to wdutil.

To run ```sysdiagnose``` in the background and write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will open Finder to the correct location or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. Keep in mind that the file sizes are approximately 300MB.
