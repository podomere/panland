## The Functioning of Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, it is common to have a Public IPv4 address such as ```231.39.205.5``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:5f73:bd7c:f418:5b52:d23d:bd07:7e77```. Verification can be performed at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, for those who are not technically inclined, communicating these addresses, as well as MAC addresses like ```84:a8:42:42:50:2d```, can be prone to errors and become complex quickly. Furthermore, this method does not provide any historical data, particularly from previous issues.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

When accessing a web page such as https://frami.com, the first step is to access a DNS server to convert the host portion (frami) along with the Top Level Domain (com) of the URL into an IP address like ```249.107.224.162```. It is worth noting that your computer and browser transmit its type with every web request, for example: ```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win 9x 4.90; SG; rv:1.9.2.4) Gecko/20101104 Netscape/9.1.0285```
## The Significance of Default Gateways

By default, the gateway is typically an automatically configured address through DHCP. It is common to receive a default gateway like ```10.25.2.46``` (though they commonly end in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size) and this is the point where your computer directs all its traffic to be routed further. For ```IPv6```, we have an in-depth analysis available at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), however Mac or Linux users can verify with:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  10.25.2.46    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:8b52:3906:68cf:5e30%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {172.229.178.246, 81.118.207.177}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 84:a8:42:42:50:2d
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr 77:0c:36:e3:c6:3d
}</pre>




## How to Resolve Connectivity Issues for Wired and Wireless Networks
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you have the option of using either a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Solutions for Apple macOS / OSX Users
Regardless of whether you are using OSX/macOS version 10.11.9, 11.2.2, or 12.2.6, there is a variety of troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a set of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes particularly beneficial, especially for teams that adopt remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA) practices.
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
A useful tool available on OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI, and can also be customized to generate specific logs for troubleshooting purposes. Furthermore, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it pertains to wireless settings and is only relevant at a specific point in time, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```. If you prefer to run it interactively, you can use<br>```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will display a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` or use Finder with Cmd+Shift+G. However, keep in mind that the file sizes can be around 300MB.
