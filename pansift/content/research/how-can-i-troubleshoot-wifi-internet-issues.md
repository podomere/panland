## Understanding Internet Protocol Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address such as ```67.16.35.137``` or an IPv6 address like ```2000:b605:d219:b1f1:6918:a4f:2259:ea7d```. This information can be verified at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, relaying or discussing these addresses, as well as MAC addresses like ```0f:ec:fa:ab:71:4e```, can be error-prone for individuals who are not tech-savvy and can become complicated. Moreover, this method does not provide any historical data, particularly during previous incidents.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

In order to access a webpage such as https://jacobson.net, you must first contact a DNS server to convert the host portion (jacobson) combined with the Top Level Domain (net) of the URL into an IP address, such as ```111.253.32.176```. Your computer and browser also transmit their type with every web request, such as <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT x.y; Win64; x64; rv:10.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0```
## Significance of Default Gateways

Your default gateway is typically an address configured automatically via DHCP. This gateway address, such as ```192.168.231.246``` (usually ending in .1 or .254 depending on the scope size), is where your computer forwards all its traffic. For ```IPv6```, detailed instructions can be found at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), but you can also verify on Mac or Linux using:
<br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.168.231.246    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:55d1:3252:6678:d71b%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.
<br>

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {214.247.127.197, 71.55.92.39}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 0f:ec:fa:ab:71:4e
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr b5:8d:fc:53:dc:82
}</pre>




## Resolving Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections

When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be utilizing a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Options for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of the version of OSX/macOS you are using, whether it's ```10.15.7```, ```11.0.8```, or ```12.1.5```, there are various tools available for resolving issues. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. Therefore, automated remote troubleshooting can be particularly useful, especially for teams that are working remotely and embracing Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Utilizing Built-in Scripts
On OSX/macOS, the ```sudo wdutil info``` tool is quite useful as it provides a dump of the current wireless-related settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it pertains to wireless settings and is only point-in-time, similar to wdutil.

To run sysdiagnose in the background and have it write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```, use the command ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &```. If you prefer to run it interactively, use the command ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose``` (although there is not much interaction). Just be aware that the file sizes are around 300MB.
