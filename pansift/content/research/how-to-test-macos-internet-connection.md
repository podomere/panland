## Understanding Internet Addressing

When using the Internet, you are assigned a unique Public IPv4 or IPv6 address, such as ```237.32.187.209``` or ```2000:a92d:3bbd:cfdf:55ca:7af3:9de:b6e5```. You can verify your address at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, effectively communicating these addresses, as well as MAC addresses like ```03:a4:bb:5c:dc:ba```, can be challenging, especially for non-technical individuals. Moreover, this method lacks historical data, making it difficult to troubleshoot previous problems.
## Navigating the World Wide Web

When accessing a website, such as https://durgan.net, your computer first contacts a DNS server to translate the URL's host portion (durgan) and Top Level Domain (net) to an IP address like ```47.172.180.128```. Additionally, your computer and browser send their type with every web request, such as <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; AOL 9.7; AOLBuild 4343.19; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; FunWebProducts)```.
## The Significance of Default Gateways

Typically assigned automatically via DHCP, your default gateway, like ```172.18.105.32``` (often ending in .1 or .254 based on the scope size), is where your computer sends all of its traffic to be routed onwards. For those interested in ```IPv6```, a detailed guide on [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/) is available for Mac or Linux users to check.
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  172.18.105.32    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:d8c6:86a7:cd9b:bc33%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {111.211.4.93, 6.82.244.68}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 03:a4:bb:5c:dc:ba
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr f9:6a:3d:56:8c:0a
}</pre>




## Solving Issues with Wired and Wireless Connections
When it comes to transmitting data to your router, you may be using a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Troubleshooting Tips for Apple macOS / OSX
No matter which version of OSX or macOS you are running, whether it's ```10.15.5```, ```11.0.4```, or ```12.2.7```, there are various tools available for troubleshooting. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting becomes essential, especially for teams that have embraced remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).
#### Useful Built-in Scripts
One incredibly useful tool on OSX/macOS is the ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless settings to the CLI and can be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although much of it only provides point-in-time information related to wireless, similar to wdutil.

Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```. If you prefer to run it *interactively*, you can use ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will display a privacy warning. If not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` or use Finder with Cmd+Shift+G to find the path. Keep in mind that the file sizes are around 300MB more or less.
