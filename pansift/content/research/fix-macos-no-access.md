derstanding How Internet Addressing Functions

When using the Internet, you are assigned a Public IPv4 address, such as ```162.114.122.6```, or an IPv6 address, like ```2000:f4c1:dfb3:a0c9:5d64:9082:5661:7c49```. You can verify this information at [https://test-ipv6.com/](https://test-ipv6.com/). However, communicating these addresses, as well as MAC addresses like ```05:22:4c:9f:de:eb```, can be prone to errors and quickly become complex, especially for individuals who are not tech-savvy. In addition, it does not provide historical data, particularly related to past issues.

  ## Navigating the Internet and the Process of Lookups
  Accessing a website such as https://beatty-hansen.com begins with connecting to a DNS server, which translates the host portion (beatty-hansen) in combination with the Top Level Domain (com) of the URL to an IP address, like ```92.237.73.157```. For all web requests, your computer and browser transmit their type, for example: <br>```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2228.0 Safari/537.36```

  ## The Significance of Default Gateways
  Your default gateway is typically an address configured automatically via DHCP, such as ```192.168.77.97``` (although they often end in .1 or .254 based on the scope size). This is where your computer sends all of its traffic to be routed further. For ```IPv6```, we provide an in-depth exploration at [how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/](/blog/how-to-fix-ipv6-connectivity/), and it can be checked on Mac or Linux using:
  <br>
### IPv4 Routes and the Host IPv4 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet | egrep -i "default|0/1|128.0/1"```

<pre>
0/1      172.18.12.193  UGScg  utun3
default  192.168.77.97    UGScg  en0
128.0/1  172.18.12.193  UGSc   utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v4 address space.

### IPv6 Routes and the Host IPv6 Route Table (inc. VPN)
```netstat -rn -f inet6 | egrep -i "default|2000::/3"```

If you have IPv6 active the above should return at least one route (as per below) via a known interface such as "_en0_ " on a Mac. 

<pre>
default   fe80:1def:9959:360d:b8ec%en0  UGcg   en0
default   fe80::%utun0                   UGcIg  utun0
default   fe80::%utun1                   UGcIg  utun1
default   fe80::%utun2                   UGcIg  utun2
2000::/3  utun3                          USc    utun3</pre>

**Note:** We are not just looking for the default but also for any VPN that overrides the public v6 address space.

## Debugging DHCP for both IPv4 and IPv6

To get a look at the low level DHCP configuration (Mac/Linux): 

```ipconfig getpacket en0```

<pre>
...
domain_name_server (ip_mult): {142.205.109.91, 102.246.98.135}
end (none):
...</pre>

So, in the above we are not getting IPv6 DNS servers from the DHCPv4 reply but...

```ipconfig getv6packet en0```

<pre>
DHCPv6 REPLY (7) Transaction ID 0x80940b Length 76
Options[4] = {
  CLIENTID (1) Length 14: DUID LLT HW 1 Time 668691856 Addr 05:22:4c:9f:de:eb
  DNS_SERVERS (23) Length 32: 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2001:4860:4860::8844
  DOMAIN_LIST (24) Length 0:  Invalid
  SERVERID (2) Length 10: DUID LL HW 1 Addr ce:b5:d2:8f:f4:7c
}</pre>




## Solutions for Wired and Wireless Connection Issues
When transferring data to your router, you may be utilizing a wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) medium at the physical and data layer.
### Effective Troubleshooting Methods for Apple macOS / OSX
Regardless of whether you are running OSX or macOS version ```10.14.7```, ```11.3.7```, or ```12.2.9```, there is a variety of troubleshooting tools available. However, these manual actions and scripts do not provide a series of correlated values over time. This is where automated remote troubleshooting comes into play, especially for teams that practice remote work and Work From Anywhere (WFA).

  #### Utilizing Built-in Scripts and Commands
  A helpful tool for OSX/macOS is ```sudo wdutil info```, which provides a dump of current wireless related settings to the CLI, and it can also be configured to generate specific logs for troubleshooting. Additionally, the ```sysdiagnose``` tool can be used to generate a wide range of logs, although many relate to wireless issues just like wdutil.

  Running ```sudo nohup /usr/bin/sysdiagnose -u &``` in the background will write logs to ```/var/tmp/<blah>.tar.gz```. If you prefer to run it *interactively*, you can execute ```sudo /usr/bin/sysdiagnose```, which will give a privacy warning. When not run in the background, it should open Finder in the correct location, or you can navigate to ```/var/tmp``` using Cmd+Shift+G in Finder. Just be mindful of the file sizes, which are approximately 300MB.
